Rel plays Dr. Seuss the ultimate compliment of treating him as a serious poet as well as one of the 20th century's most interesting visual artists, and after reading his book I decided that a trip to the Mandeville Collections of the library at University of California in San Diego was in order, so I could visit some of the incredible Seuss/Geisel holdings they have there.There's almost too much to take in, for, like William Butler Yeats, Seuss led a career that constantly shifted and metamoprhized itself to meet new historical and political cirsumstances, so he seems to have been both a leftist and a conservative at different junctures of his career, both in politics and in art. As Nel shows us, he was once a cartoonist for the fabled PM magazine and, like Andy Warhol, he served his time slaving in the ad business too. All was in the service of amusing and broadening the minds of US children. Nel doesn't hesitate to administer a sound spanking to the Seuss industry that, since his death, has seen fit to license all kinds of awful products including the recent CAT IN THE HAT film with Mike Myers. Oh, what a cat-astrophe!The book is great and I can especially recommend the work of the picture editor who has given us a bounty of good illustrations."

For me, a daddy to a large family who learned to read with Dr. Seuss and who has memorized too many of the books via repeated readings to young children, Prof. Nel's brilliant 'American Icon' is a long awaited treat. At last a serious treatment of this remarkable genius that is both an engaging read and filled with remarkable insights! I especially enjoyed (and learned more than I care to admit from) Prof. Nel's discussions of the Disneyfication of Seuss - which Nel links to failings in American copyright law, ""the other sides of Dr. Seuss"" - all of which sides were new to me, and the political genesis of his secular morality in the WWII cartoon work he did at PM magazine. The chapters on Geisel's poetry and artwork and the link Nel makes between Seuss and the historical avant guarde alone make this book a ""must buy"" for parents and serious readers, not to mention public libraries. Readers of Nel's other books will find the same engaging writing style that makes the book a fun read while imparting a mountain of information and important ideas. This is simply the best and most comprehensive book yet written on the work of Seuss Geisel and what will certainly be the standard for many years to come. Thank you, Prof. Nel, wherever you are, from a reader who grew up with the good doctor and who is growing up with him again years later. Your book, written from your encyclopeadic knowledge of children's literature and the media of this genre - from scanning verse to cubist painting! - explains the power, limits, and popularity of the Seuss phenomenon."
3,0826414346,Dr. Seuss: American Icon,,A2MVUWT453QH61,"Roy E. Perry ""amateur philosopher""",7/7,4.0,1090713600,Phlip Nel gives silly Seuss a serious treatment,"Theodore Seuss Geisel (1904-1991), aka &quot;Dr. Seuss,&quot; was one of the most influential writers and artists of the 20th century.In 1959, Rudolf Flesch wrote, &quot;A hundred years from now, children and their parents will still eagerly read the books of a fellow called Ted Geisel, popularly known as Dr. Seuss.&quot;Flesch was too conservative in his prediction. A century, and more, from today, Dr. Seuss will still be read when many authors on today's bestseller lists will be forgotten.Published on the centenary of Geisel's birth, Dr. Seuss: American Icon analyzes six key aspects of Seuss's career: poetry, politics, art, biography, marketing, and influence.In six insightful chapters, Philip Nel, Assistant Professor of English at Kansas State University, discusses &quot;U.S. Laureate of Nonsense,&quot; &quot;Dr. Seuss vs. Adolf Hitler,&quot; &quot;The Doc in the Smock,&quot; &quot;The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. S.,&quot; &quot;The Disneyfication of Dr. Seuss,&quot; and &quot;The Cat in the Hat for President.&quot;Nel gives short shrift to Geisel's childhood and family background--and, indeed, to biography in general--preferring to focus on Seuss's writing and art, from his first book, And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (1937) to his last book, Oh, the Places You'll Go! (1990).Dr. Seuss's breakthrough year was 1957, when he published the two books with which he is most often identified: The Cat in the Hat and How the Grinch Stole Christmas!Other classic works in the Seussian canon are: Horton Hears a Who! (&quot;A person's a person, no matter how small&quot;), Yertle the Turtle (modeled on the rise of Adolf Hitler), Green Eggs and Ham (Seuss's bestselling book), The Sneeches (a criticism of anti-Semitism), The Lorax (a protest against corporate abuse of the environment), and The Butter Battle Book (a critique of Reagan's enthusiasm for the nuclear arms trace).His favorite work, among the books he authored, was The Cat in the Hat, for it, more than any other, taught children to read.While many of his books have a clear and powerful moral, Seuss had a horror of heavy-handed preaching. He sought to teach and ignite the imagination, but was a lifelong opponent of smug, self-righteous bourgeois moralism.&quot;Seuss was a contrarian,&quot; writes Nel, &quot;who enjoyed challenging people to reconsider their assumptions. [He had a] rebellious imagination and a dispositional distaste for rules and regulations.&quot; His work was a &quot;rational insanity&quot; that exhibited &quot;joyous anarchy&quot; and a &quot;lifelong thrill in misbehaving.&quot;A better subtitle for Nel's work would have been American Icon and Iconoclast.Nel tells of Seuss's early years as an advertising artist and as a agitprop cartoonist. The book, however, is not a biography; it is a serious study in the genres of literary and art criticism.For readers who want more biographical information, Nel recommends Dr. Seuss and Mr. Geisel, by Judith Morgan and Neil Morgan (1995), which he describes as &quot;the definitive biography and the single best secondary source on Seuss. Any discussion of Seuss's life and work must begin with this book.&quot;Dr. Seuss: American Icon includes 103 pages of notes, index, and the most comprehensive annotated Seuss bibliography ever assembled. One learns a lot from this book; the author's lucid style makes it not only an enlightening work but a fun read.Philip Nel is the author of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter Novels: A Reader's Guide (2001) and The Avant-Garde and American Postmodernity (2002).Roy E. Perry of Nolensville, Tennessee, is an advertising copywriter at a Nashville publishing house."
4,0826414346,Dr. Seuss: American Icon,,A22X4XUPKF66MR,"D. H. Richards ""ninthwavestore""",3/3,4.0,1107993600,Good academic overview,"Philip Nel - Dr. Seuss: American IconThis is basically an academic overview of Seuss poetry, art, cartoons, and the problems with the commercialization of the Seuss name and works after his death. It is not, to any real extent, a biography. Those seeking such should move on.As an academic book it leans on the dry side. It assumes the reader has a fairly good knowledge of Children's Literature and 20th Century cartoons (not the animated kind). Not a book to begin your Dr. Seuss experience with. But if you have read them to your children and are interested about the writing style (there is a good chapter about his poetry) or his art style (not as good a chapter, but still interesting).What interested me the most was the deconstruction of the recent rush to ""cash in"" on Seuss by Hollywood and advertisers. I think that Nel wants to come down against it, but based on Seuss' background (he started out drawing Flit ads) and the projects he approved during his lifetime; it is a tough argument to make. In the end though Nel does point out that maybe the movies and tie- ins did not have to be so... crass?The book is well researched; lots of neat tidbits are to be gleamed. Early cartoons by Seuss for PM magazine were occasionally (by today's standards) shockingly racist. It makes him a little more human and puts his latter works like the Lorax in a new light.Those in Education may enjoy this background. Fans of Seuss will enjoy the exhaustive bibliography of Seuss's many, many works. Also good list of other works about the man."
5,0826414346,Dr. Seuss: American Icon,,A2F6NONFUDB6UK,Malvin,2/2,4.0,1127174400,One of America's greatest creative talents,"""Dr. Seuss: American Icon"" by Philip Nel is a thoughtful deconstruction of the life and work of Theodore Geisel (aka Dr. Seuss). In this thoughtful book, Mr. Nel deepens our appreciation for Seuss as a distinctively American poet, artist and educator. The author demonstrates Seuss' wide ranging influence and argues for his rightful place among the most important cultural figures of the 20th century.An English professor at Kansas State University, Mr. Nel uses his historic knowledge to discuss how Seuss' text belongs to a tradition of great nonsense writers. Mr. Nel states that Seuss' carefully-constructed absurdist tales encourage children to challenge the status quo by gently skewering the grown-up world; elsewhere, he uses charts to show how Seuss effectively used meter and rhyme to complement his intentionally ridiculous plots and create masterful stories that have stood up well to the test of time.Mr. Nel recounts Seuss' early career as advertising illustrator and political cartoonist to help us better understand the influences that shaped his classic children's work. As an artist, Mr. Nel suggests that the term ""energetic cartoon surrealism"" appropriately describes Seuss' creative synthesis of cubism, art nouveau, surrealism and other styles. While Seuss' influence can be detected in modern rap music, children's books, political cartoons and more, Mr. Nel contends that Seuss would not have been happy about the manner in which his works have been posthumously marketed, opining that the ""Disneyification"" or simplification of Seuss' stories for marketable purposes ""threatens to make 'Seuss' synomynous with the ambiguous power of global capitalism"". Such commercialism would appear to collide with Seuss' desire to develop critical thinking among young people and to help us all imagine a better world.I highly recommend this book for everyone interested in gaining greater insight and perspective into one of America's greatest creative talents."

Giesel created not only his famous imaginative picturebooks, but a unique art and poetry, and even a place for himself in politics. Philip Nel argues that these added activities make Dr. Seuss one of the most influential people in America - certainly the most influential poet - and Dr. Seuss: American Icon provides the reader an memorably excellent survey of Dr. Seuss' many achievements."

In fact, he's writes so far from it, with a smart and precise style, I am tempted to revise how I feel about professor-writers. However, in accordance with his academia roots, Nel has a 100 page annotated bibliogarphy that goes along with his work, a nice shrine to prove his homework was well done.As far the actual book goes it is an excellent piece work. ""Dr. Seuss: American Icon"" looks at the man behind Dr. Suess not as a straight-forward biography, but rather it focuses on different areas of Dr. Suess (i.e. poet, poetry of, artist, artistic style, adult, activist, etc.) and interjects those discussions with biogrphical anecdotes. A very effective attention keeping method.If you're interested in learning more about the work and the man behind the work of Dr. Suess, this is the book that speaks to both and even more.

9,0826414346,Dr. Seuss: American Icon,,A3VA4XFS5WNJO3,Donald Burnside,3/5,4.0,1076371200,Fascinating account of a genius at work,"As far as I am aware, this is the first book-length study of the work of Dr. Seuss, and Philip Nel has done an excellent job. If the word 'study' makes you nervous, rest assured: this is not a jargon-filled, pretentious analysis. It is, instead, a nicely written work that views Seuss from several different angles: as a poet, a visual artist, a cartoonist, and so on. Nel writes intelligently on how Seuss fits into the canon of nonsense poets, and provides good background on the roots of Seuss's visual style. Some of the WW2/political cartoon material I had read about before, but Nel covers it thoroughly. The most fascinating chapter to me deals with the marketing of Seuss, particularly since his death. Nel holds forth strongly on the abominable 'Grinch' movie (and I trust he feels the same way about the 'Cat in the Hat' film too), and gets into a very interesting discussion of the possible motivations behind the ever-expanding empire of Dr. Seuss Enterprises. (And no, I don't believe it is purely about the profits!)Two small quibbles prevent me from awarding five stars. Firstly, I would have liked the book to be a little longer. The in-depth bibliography is interesting in itself and will be a goldmine to future researchers, but I'm sure Nel could have found a few more things to say - perhaps about Seuss's gender politics. Secondly, the dust jacket on my copy was a little loose."

There are some very good tips about altering worship for smaller congregations and valuing it's unique size and working with it well.For the thousands of us who find ourselves in churches with membership of 100 or less, for those who are discouraged when worship attendence is 30 or 40 during the summer, this book is such an uplifting perspective you can't help but be energized!Unlike many tomes of this nature, this is an easy read and the layperson can gobble it up and immediately put it to use.

This is the book on worship,"I hadn't been a small church pastor very long before I began to hear about David R. Ray. If you do any reading in this area, you'll start to see other authors refer to him and a handful of others, especially Anthony Pappas and Carl Dudley (who are also excellent). But Ray is different. Reading his work, I felt as if he had actually visited MY home church. He describes some of the personalities in a church family, and I could supply their names. He lists some of the ""Thou Shalts"" of a strong worship service, and I heard echoes of my most recent deacons' meeting. He not only gets small church culture, he celebrates it, and he is eager to help small churches learn to get and to celebrate themselves. If you are part of a church where low-morale often coexists with feisty pride, this is a resource that will help. It offers some ways of identifying what church families with 50 or fewer need and hope for from their churches, and how to offer it in ways that are inclusive, warm, fun and authentic. Hallelujah!"

Examples: a bed squeaks slightly and sharply in the same sentence; a nightgown hangs freely over her girlish figure and olive colored complexion; coffee aromas huddle; rumbling clouds huddle (as well as the coffee?); she prepared to sip her coffee beneath the wrath of God... cuddled within the arms of a strong breeze; (the wrath of God is a breeze?); the Columbian (stet) coffee aroma danced beneath her sculpted tan nose; the coffee bean fragrance tangoed within her body; she placed her thick pink lips against the warm cup;... and so on, all by page three.

On the bad side I have to say, there was a typo featured on the back cover and the secret to liking this book is making it through the first chapter. I have to admit I was a little curious when I read some of the reviews. They were so mean and false that it spiked my curiosity. I then like the last review noticed that the ""Traveling librarian"" wrote a completely ignorant review on this book. My first thought was wait a minute, that was not the book that I read. I read my copy once again and realized her entire review was fabricated. Then I knew, it was some kind of game.

However, the author should probably stick to marketing and give up the idea of being a writer. This book could have been written by a middle-schooler.

There is no substance, no character development, and the plot (if there actually is one) is pathetic. I generally trust the reviewers on Amazon.

""The bed squeaked slightly, but her husband was unmoved by the sharp squeaks from the bed as well as the howling noises caused by the wind that were surrounding him."" Were the squeaks slight or sharp, and were she and her husband sleeping outside that the wind could be howling around him not the house? This is just one mangled sentence in a book filled with such tripe. If my criticism seems harsh, it's because I actually paid money for this book. What a waste!I would suggest that Miss Haddon go back to Junior High School and begin a serious course of writing instruction.

I howled with laughter all the way through, wondering how much worse it could get - and sure enough, it got worse. If the writing is bad, the plot is ludicrous. A preacher comes to offer condolences the same afternoon that the heroine's husband is shot dead. Within moments they are having sex. The sex is not sensually treated or beautifully described - no, all they do is stick their tongues down each other's throats. The preacher goes to tell his paralysed wife. Her bizarre response - wait for it - is to stick her tongue down his throat. No wonder he veers away. The heroine runs off to work in the heart of Liverpool in a rose garden ten miles long (I kid you not). Did I mention she is dying? But never mind, she'll make a miraculous recovery. She meets another man - even though, conveniently, he's dying too, and she's pregnant by the preacher by now (and, oh joy, she hears the heartbeat of the fetus at a week... truly, a miracle)! The other man lives in castle and is very rich. Of course. They consumate their affair when she sticks her tongue down his throat. Not to worry, she doesn't have to perform this crude tonsil-tickling for long. The preacher turns up again. Everyone in the way drops dead, leaving the coast free for the ""wicked saints"" of the title to romp without blame or shame into the sunset.I could have kicked myself for buying this book; but I had been fooled by reading a mention of it by a so-called reviewer of The Mermaid Chair (which is a good book.) Then I checked all the other reviews done by reviewers of Ms Haddon's book (you can click on ""other reviews"" to see what I mean) and believe I have spotted a scam. The reviewers appear to have chosen the same half dozen best sellers to review -- each on the same day! - and in each review of these other genuinely good books they mention Wicked Saints in the most glowing terms. This is cynical piggy-back riding on bona fide books, made worse because this is a very badly edited (and badly written) self published book. I hope few people will be fooled as I was - and as Amazon has been. Be warned!"

The book's three sections move from a focus on spirituality and healing, to theology in social and political context, and on to questions of identity and diaspora.The book begins with the voices of female practitioners and then offers a broad, interdisciplinary examination of Caribbean religion and culture. Afro-Caribbean religions, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity are all addressed, with specific reflections on Santer&iacute;a, Palo Monte, Vodou, Winti, Obeah, Kali Mai, Orisha work, Spiritual Baptist faith, Spiritualism, Rastafari, Confucianism, Congregationalism, Pentecostalism, Catholicism, and liberation theology. Some essays are based on fieldwork, archival research, and textual or linguistic analysis, while others are concerned with methodological or theoretical issues. Contributors include practitioners and scholars, some very established in the field, others with fresh, new approaches; all of them come from the region or have done extensive fieldwork or research there. In these essays the poetic vitality of the practitioner's voice meets the attentive commitment of the postcolonial scholar in a dance of ""nations"" across the waters."
47,0802841899,The Church of Christ: A Biblical Ecclesiology for Today,25.97,ARI272XF8TOL4,Christopher J. Bray,74/81,5.0,955411200,Ecclesiological Milestone,"With the publication of Everett Ferguson's book on ecclesiology, another milestone has been reached in the scholarly presentation of the distinctive theological perspective of Churches of Christ. The book is divided into six chapters, each roughly sixty to seventy pages in length. Within each chapter, Ferguson neatly and systematically outlines his thoughts and arguments. The first chapter, entitled ""The People and the Messiah: History and Eschatology,"" deals mainly with background issues. It examines the Old Testament teaching on the importance of covenant and the meaning of the phrase ""kingdom of God"" in its relationship to an and distinction from the church. Ferguson enters into the New Testament and ecclesiology proper via a consideration of Jesus as Messiah, including a careful exegesis of Matt. 16:13-23, where he concludes that the ""rock"" of Matt. 16:18 is not Peter, but the fact of Jesus' Messiahship. Ferguson's analysis of Matt. 16:13-23 is insightful and carefully articulated. Within this section, he gives attention to ""the gates of Hades will not prevail"" and concludes with some interesting yet encouraging insight. In the second chapter, ""The Church and Her Lord: The Nature of the Church,"" Ferguson deals with and focuses on three images, ""people of God,"" ""body of Christ,"" and ""community of the Spirit."" A peculiar feature in this chapter is placing the discussion of the word ekklesia last rather than first. The latter would seem more appropriate and would seem to set the stage for the chapter, especially for a work of biblical ecclesiology. This great section will open the eyes of the reader and renew his focus of church. That is to say, this chapter correctly puts Christ as the head of the church and gives Him His appropriate place. The third chapter concentrates on, ""The Church and Her Savior: Salvation and Church Membership."" Essentially this section covers soteriology, which determines ecclesiology, but it is not ecclesiology itself. His full treatment of the nature of sin, the meaning of the cross, and the human response to God's saving work is only loosely linked to his topic of ecclesiology. This is not to say that this section is uninteresting or uninformative because it is quite helpful for a fuller understanding of these matters. Far more important is the content of Ferguson's soteriology. Ferguson is strong when it comes to the necessity of baptism. A few statements will give the reader an idea of his position: ""Baptism is the time at which one is incorporated into Christ and so becomes a child of God"" (pg. 170); ""Baptism is a `calling on the name' of the Lord"" (pg. 180); and, ""Baptism is the appointed time at which God pronounces forgiveness"" (pg. 183). He concludes: There must be an objective necessity about baptism, or New Testament writers could not speak of baptism in the way they do"" (pg. 185). How refreshing! In our world of relativity and ecumenism, people need to hear Ferguson's words, especially those in Churches of Christ. The last three chapters move into a more familiar territory for a treatise on the church. Chapter four, ""The Church and Her High Priest: Worship and Assembly"" is a great section for anyone interested in the dynamics of worship. Here, Ferguson begins with a type of etymology as a way of introduction, concentrating on both the Greek and English words. This introduction to the subject sets the stage for the entire chapter. Worship is a hot topic today, thus chapter four is rather applicable for our day with all the differing views. This section is multitudinously faceted and exhaustive. ""The Church and Her Bishop: The Continuing Ministry"" is appropriately the title for the fifth chapter. In this section, Ferguson again touches on some hot topics in the church. It is unfortunate however that he only briefly deals with the debates on miraculous gifts and women's roles. Ferguson advocates a cessasionist position on miraculous gifts and a complementarian position on women's roles, but leaves the reader thirsting for more information and a more comprehensive treatment of the issues. In a day where these two in particular issues are so widely discussed and debated, one would think that they might have received a little concentration. Again, this is not to eradicate what was accomplished in this chapter because it was insightful and obliging, especially given the fact that his discussion on deaconesses was amazingly insightful and well balanced. In chapter six Ferguson adequately covers, ""The Church and Her Teacher: The New Way of Life."" In this section, he includes an unusually prominent consideration of ethics and a very healthy discussion of the importance of Christian fellowship and its concomitant, church discipline. One last thing that must be mentioned about this chapter is Ferguson's section on unity. Although this section is brief, it is significant and insightful. Ferguson lays out the various aspects of unity and does so in just a few short pages. It serves as an excellent conclusion to a monumental work. Of course, any reader is free to take issue with some of Ferguson's conclusions. For example, the distinction that is made between the temporary and permanent endowments of the Spirit still awaits additional clarification, and there will be those who will score Ferguson, despite his disclaimer, for his synchronic rather than diachronic approach to the New Testament writings. This is a courageous book. Its Reformed-Restorationist slant that the proper doctrine of the church entails a return to the faith and practice of the apostolic church is unmistakable. There are numerous nuggets of exegesis and important points of emphases that make this book worth reading. It is astounding that Ferguson deals with so many facets of ecclesiology in a one-volume work. Not only that, but he also includes a helpful subject index as well as a number of bibliographies. Just a glance at his copious footnotes and it is clear that this book is well researched and well documented. This book should be one that every minister, church leader, and ministry student is required to read and ponder."

In Rising Sons and Daughters, we learn thatJapanese young people are preserving their country's tradition of respect for their elders while also creating their own identity as Japan's &quot;Generation X&quot;. Like our own young people, they are bombarded with some of the excesses of &quot;Western culture&quot; - Clothing fads, rock groups, a culture of shopping, etc. What they seem to be developing, however, is a healthy hybrid of old and new that retains a firm foundation in good values.

I don't know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community, and their peers' adulation of Western culture. True to form, the &quot;New Young&quot; of Japan seem to be creating an &quot;international&quot; blend, as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family. Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author, adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens, and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out. A great read!"

No filters are between us and the experiences he had day to day. All the details about school, family life and learning the language comes to us without any forethought.Compared to other books on Japan this is raw, unmolded, information and is full of insight that I doubt even Wardell realized was amazing for such a young writer. I would say that this is a must for anybody planning on going to Japan for ANY reason.Did find some humor in the fact that Wardell felt the need to explain everything, even what a corn dog was, and that when he met other exchange students one complained about how the Japanese, and I quote, Couldn't even speak English good, end of quote.

It offers the opinions of a diverse sample of real Muslim Women with very different attitudes. It will not appeal to those who don't want to listen or who want an anti-islamic feminist political tract. The value of this is that you hear the opinions, educated and not, of the real people involved.Most of the time, the real voices are ignored and what is presented in the name of feminism is non-muslim american female TV personalities yacking endlessly on about the lives and experiences of people they really don't know and don't want to know.What must be understood above all else is that if you wish to change a society or a culture, you must at the very least understand how the people in that culture who disagree with you think. That is what this book does so well. I may not agree at all with the opinion of every woman in the book, but I at least understand how they think after finishing it.What many will never understand is that Islamic Society has changed and is still changing. But it can only change by consensus from within. No amount of cultural imperialism from western countries is going to change anything for the better.There is also more than a little hypocracy. For all the lectures about the veil from American Women, few of them stop to think about why they are themselves forced into certain choices. A veil isn't great, but its a whole lot more confortable than the pantyhose that many Western women must wear effectively as a condition of employment. One wonders at a certain point if its the veil itself they object to or that as constrasted to their money-driven appearance decisons, the veil has a meaning beyond the secular."

Unfortunately, I found the opposite to be the case.I've made numerous attempts to get my head around the principles of the Dramatica theory, with the intention of finally being able to put to use the rather pricey Dramatica Pro software I bought years ago. Both the software itself, and the book of theory explaining it (""Dramatica: A New Theory of Story"") are so riddled with specialized (and somewhat proprietary) jargon that I've long counted myself among the number of users for whom the effort to grasp the principles involved outweighed the potential benefits. (And BTW, I'm no newcomer to the basic premises of story structure; I've got an MFA from a respectable film school, and have worked for many years as a film editor.)I'd had high hopes for ""Dramatica For Screenwriters"", figuring it would serve as a practical layman's guide to understanding and using the software. Unfortunately (there's that word again), despite claims in the author's introduction to the contrary, a few pages in the jargon begins coming at the reader hot and heavy, and unlike in ""Dramatica: A New Theory of Story"", which I already found to be too opaque, here much of the jargon is not even explained in a cursory manner. Reader familiarity is assumed, which would seem to defeat the purpose of the book in the first place. So the reader is left with a bit of a Catch-22: if you need the book, you probably won't understand it, and if you can understand the book, you probably don't need it."

However, as someone who has read several other books (Richard Montauk's &quot;How To Get Into the Top Law Schools,&quot; Robert Miller's &quot;Law School Confidential&quot; and more) and done the necessary research on the internet, this book brought very little new information to the table. Perhaps the most unique thing about this book is the &quot;15 essential factors&quot;...unfortunately, many of those 15 factors--though essential--are things the average person applying to law school--particularly top law schools--doesn't care about and might cast aside even after reading this book.I do agree with her that many pre-law advisers are ill-prepared to advise pre-law students and don't know nearly as much as they should. However, if the info in this book is the information she provided other pre-law advisers with, then it's nothing that the advisers nor the students couldn't have come up with themselves or elsewhere. I still say Montauk's book is the best on law school admissions out there, regardless of what schools you're interested in. HIS book is the one with all the insider secrets in it. Wright's book is just a very broad overview of the admissions process, in my opinion.The one thing this book totally has in common with Montauk's book that is very disappointing is that they do nothing to help minorities know what the admissons process will truly be like for them or how to handle it. For that, you have to look up books by Evangeline Mitchell. Most books have a tendency to treat everyone the same, as if all the information applies to them the same, and that is deceiving.In conclusion, if you feel pretty well-informed already about admissions or are looking for an extra bit of information that might give you that edge or illuminate your particular situation...this book is not the one for you. Only if you really know very little about law school admissions might this book be worth it...but I'd still say it'd be best to go with Montauk's eye-opening admissions guide."

She is on the side of reticence and writes with the pained nostalgia of a Southerner describing aspects of the War Between the States. Guerstein knows that reticence is a lost cause; she asks only whether it should be.Gurstein makes a quiet case for the reintroduction of taste, judgement, and sensibility into our public lives. This is a common theme these days. What is uncommon is that she derives her &quot;argument&quot; (always presented with the greatest of civility) from the distortion of privacy that somehow led from Brandeis's great legal work on privacy to the transformation of social man to private men and women and eventually to the public dissemination of all sorts of private matters. This is innovative and intriguing.Reticence should emerge from the coordinated behavior of civilized persons; it should not be coerced by legislation and litigation. It is thus especially appropriate that Gurstein never hectors or lectures. Instead, she paints such a delightful alternative portrait of life, far from morning talk radio, nightly real tv, and ever-present commercial messages in nearly all media, that she inspires the reader to aspire toward at least some aspects of reticence.I felt that Gurstein did not define reticence early enough and failed to take advantage of the opportunities to add more detail as the book progressed. I assume that the party of reticence acquired useful knowledge over time, such as after its (happily) failed efforts to prosecute the publisher of Joyce's Ulysses. But these reservations are minor.My most serious concern is whether the domestic party of reticence has foreign (and sometimes not-so-foreign) counterparts in governments that have successfully enforced taste through stern rule of law. I would have appreciated a treatment of these cultural (or anti-cultural) forces. Althoug! h very difficult, such an effort would have greatly sharpened my understanding of the tenets of the party of reticence and its role in our society. Gurstein surely knows that the mere existence of such potential counterparts to her domestic party of reticence may chill further inquiry; after all, she records numerous instances in which the party of exposure has dangled straw men for talismanic protection from true debate. It would be very useful if Gurstein, accounting for the human rights of those oppressed by governmental regimes, could make a better case for the human rights of those increasingly oppressed by the party of exposure, whose methodology of oppression is vastly different. The incremental personal losses to the party of exposure do not lend themselves to the same degree of drama, but possibly, over a sufficiently long period of time, they can present, cumulatively, a meaningful loss of freedom.Henry James wrote that the words, &quot;summer afternoon&quot; were the most pleasant in the English language.

At the time jogging/running was becoming quite popular, so I took that up. I like to read so I read the Jim Fixx book on running which led me to Dr Cooper's book ""Aerobics"" (a term he coined), then to ""Aerobics Program for total Well Being..."", which became sort of a bible for a long time. After retirement I quit smoking and started going to a doctor. Found to be out of shape - again - I looked up Dr Cooper and saw his book ""Start Strong, Finish Strong"" which I absorbed like a sponge dropped in a bucket of water. Joined a gym and started the prescription of 55% aerobics, 45% strength and have never felt better. Now I've got one doctor trying to tie me down to hypertension drugs. That diagnosis was contrary to my own readings, so I'm in the middle of a complete cardio workup. (The initial stress test results were great, waiting for the in depth analysis.) When I saw this book it was a gotta have.In this book Dr. Cooper very thoughtfully presents all factors in a very helpful manner with a goal of controlling blood pressure without medications, but points out factors that could make them necessary. After my first reading I feel like I can more intelligently discuss the stress test results with my cardiologist, then better deal with my general physician.I would hardily, strongly recommend this book for any person who has had a too high blood pressure reading."

Dad acquired some starter in about 1959 that its guardian said had been going since the days of the 49ers. I know it's been bubbling since then. All Dad made, though, were bread and rubbery pancakes. He, unfortunately, didn't buy a copy for himself, although I'd give anything to have him make another meal of them! You see, that's the magic of sourdough, the romance, the stories, the memories! I've not yet been to Alaska, but Ruth Allman has taken me from Cheechako to Sourdough by generously sharing her recipes and her stories with me. I read this book just for the enjoyment of it sometimes. We had her waffles this morning. I made her Flower Rolls recipe into Danish rolls for my famously fussy father-in-law. What better tribute could I make to this cook and her book than to say that he loved them! My two year old son and I will make a little fire in the woods and bake a sourdough version of bannock in Dad's old Dutch oven this week and make some memories of our own."

Overall, this book gives some of the best history of sourdough from a lady who knows first-hand the importance of an active sourdough starter, and will get any beginner started off making some very good breads, rolls, breakfast items & desserts. There is even a section at the end for making various products from the wild berries grown in the Last Frontier (for those of us who are able to utilize lingonberries & such)!

The stories were informative, a fascinating look at history, and most of all - FUN! Then, because she made it sound so easy and delectable - I decided to try making sourdough and see what would happen. I had to go back and forth in the book a little to make sure I was doing everything correctly - the Sourdough Hints in the back were very helpful. Well, it's been a week since I mixed up the starter. The sourdough smelled ""sour cream sour"" and it looked OK. (I was glad not to see little black fungus or other such nasties growing on the surface like the last sourdough I tried to make 20 years ago). So I made the Quick Sourdough Bread today. I figured that was a good place to start since I didn't want to take time for the 2 risings that the regular Sourdough Bread recipe called for. It rose nicely in the pan. It smelled good. But I did take it out of the oven 10 minutes early, because it was a deep golden brown and I was afraid it would be a rock-hard loaf if I waited the full 45 minutes. I brushed butter on the crust to soften it a little (still paranoid about the possible hard crust) and waited for it to cool. I sliced it. My husband and I had one slice. Then we had another. (And, yes, then we had one more with black cherry jam!) Oh My Goodness!! I haven't had bread that tasted that good in a LONG time!! My husband put it this way, ""It is a slice of Heaven!"". I agreed wholeheartedly - better than candy, cake or cookies! So take it from a person who has hundreds of cook books and probably thousands of recipes and has cooked all sorts of bread for the last 30+ years - this book is worth getting. It made the best bread we have ever eaten and now I can't wait to try some of the other recipes in the book. Four thumbs up."

The handwritten style and illustrations are reminiscent of, perhaps, an early scratch draft of ""The Moosewood"" done with a sharpie instead of a nib and ink. But the recipes for bread are poorly assembled.Any bread maker knows how the proportionality of ingredients is key for bread. I've tried two of the four bread recipes so far and neither have performed well. One recipe calls for 8 to 10 cups of flour, which I halved, and so attempted 4 to 5 cups. At 3 cups, my dough was full. Okay, yes, great variety of atmospheres and starter consistency, yes, but the next recipe was like that too. And my sponge has not raised a mm in 24 hours. Perhaps it's too cold in my kitchen? Nevertheless, don't expect this book to even hint at how long a rise will take.And what kind of sourdough calls for baking soda or commercial yeast? The kinds in this book!I'm not claiming to be an expert on bread, but I've made two loaves a week for 2 years now, with a lot of success with other cookbooks (America's Bread Book, The Bread Book, My Bread); I think this one is lame.

Briggs ""Tessa B""",8/14,3.0,1241827200,Not your quick refrence cookbook,"After having a chance to read through the book I am not sure I would have bothered purchasing it in a store. The ""sourdough lore"" is very interesting but in order to make the book seem more ""authentically old"" the author has hand-written each and every page. That's right, the only thing typed in this book is the copyright info. Her handwriting is more or less legible but it's much more difficult to read at a glance and the frequent misspellings bother me. The instructions also assume that you already know how to do a lot of things. For example, on the recipe for doughnuts it says to mix the ingredients, allow to rise, and the deep fry the cut doughnuts. I have to cut doughnuts? Is there anything I do to them first? I don't know, because none of that is included in the recipe. Also, there is no master index.Finally, all the recipes I have gone through are scaled to make massive portions. There is no eating for two out of this cookbook and you can't cut them down because they call for an odd number of eggs. Example - the pancake recipe will make about 15-20 medium sized pancakes (and calls for two cups of sourdough starter - not workable for people who don't have huge batches of starter) yet calls for only 1 egg.UPDATE: After working with this cookbook more, I wish I could have given it a lower review. It's not really a cookbook as there are probably only about 5 unique recipes. Everything else is a VARIATION that she calls a new recipe. And some of her suggestions are just plain gross. Corned beef and Worcestershire pancakes? Cottage cheese and smoked fish pancake roll ups? Ick! There are about 10,000 things she recommends doing with waffles but these are not unique recipes - these are tips, hints, and VARIATIONS. Cover waffles with ice cream, meringue, pancakes, ham, make them a sandwich, cook them with curry and dip them in fish paste. YUCKO!"

Don't get me wrong, ""Alaska Sourdough"" is as much interesting from an historical standpoint as it is for the unique recipes derived from ""on the trail"" sourdoughs who purportedly derived these concoctions over many, many years of preserving their stock of sourdough. One gets the feeling that sourdough was the lifeblood--the sustaining force--that kept many of Alaska's intrepid miners and inevitable shysters alive when all other earthly endeavors and pleasures had evaporated.The unique uses for sourdough (makes a wonderful glue, did you know?) keeps the book moving forward, and the recipes can be a bit bizarre, especially the numerous uses of mixing clams in pancake and muffin recipes. If you're looking for more practical recipes, Ruth Allman includes those as well in what appears to be a handwritten book, simulating the feel of recipes jotted down on note cards or loose pieces of paper. The section on waffles and pancakes I found to be very useful; however, the section on creating basic sourdough bread seemed to be laborious compared to the many no-knead methods other sourdough experts espouse. A good sourdough starter is its own leavening agent, creating a dough that will rise on its own. Allman's recipes frequently encourage the use of baking soda, baking powder, and even commercial yeast to speed up the respective recipe processes. This concept might not set too well with traditional sourdough bakers.""Alaska Sourdough"" does not take too long to peruse. After doing so, I did a little research on Ruth Allman and her husband and found their influence to be substantial in the Juneau, Alaska community in the early 20th Century. I would encourage anyone who found the historical aspect of ""Alaska Sourdough"" to be compelling to look into the House of Wickersham and Ruth Allman's interesting involvement in its development and perpetuation."

Do you want to give yourself a top-flight graduate course on this exciting philosophical topic? Then read Robert Kane's The Oxford Handbook on Free Will. This book might be the single best book to study if one wants a comprehensive overview of most of the controversies unfolding in debates about free will and moral responsibility. The essays are all outstanding. Each is penned by one of the leading figures in the field, and each combines an effort to teach at a very advanced level with a novel contribution to the literature pitched from the perspective of the author. For example, in the section devoted to compatibilism (the view that free will and moral responsibility are compatible with determinism), Kane includes four essays, one by Bernard Berofsky, another by Ishtiyaque Haji, a third by Paul Russell, and a forth by Daniel Dennett and Christopher Taylor. Each essay is detailed, crisp, completely informed, and clear as a bell. Each also advances the author's own views. Reading through this section, one can learn exactly what is now taking place in the arena of compatibilism. The same can be said about the section devoted to libertarianism (the thesis that some persons act from a sort of free will that requires the falsity of determinism). In this section, Kane includes probably the four finest philosophers currently defending this topic, Tim O'Connor, Randy Clarke, Carl Ginet, and Kane himself.In all, there are eight sections to Kane's collection with a total of 25 essays. The sections are devoted to the following topics: 1) theological issues as they pertain to free will, 2) theories of physics and the free will problem, 3) the consequence argument (a highly influential argument for the thesis that determinism is incompatible with the ability to do otherwise), 4) compatibilism, 5) the relevance of alternative possibilities for moral responsibility (some philosophers think that the freedom to act otherwise is not required for moral responsibility), 6) libertarian views, 7) non-standard views about the relationship between free will, moral responsibility and determinism (such as the view that no one has free will or moral responsibility regardless of the truth or falsity of determinism), and finally, 8) neuroscientific influences on our understanding of the free will topic. An impressive range of topics indeed.I have been publishing and writing on the topics of free will and moral responsibility for over 10 years now and I simply know of no single collection that even approximates the impressive quality and breadth of Kane's handbook. It is an outstanding book."

Robert Kane has certainly done his part to keep up the trend.All of the essays in this volume are written by philosophers who have made significant individual contributions to the contemporary discussion about human freedom. Most of the authors have also produced influential works in related fields (philosophy of mind, action theory and moral psychology), and many of them are thoroughly conversant with the relevant empirical research in physics and neuroscience. Indeed, parts II and VIII of the book are dedicated, respectively, to the interplay between the problems of free will and quantum physics/chaos theory on the one hand, and recent work in neuroscience on the other. The result is a compilation of essays written with the sort of texture and philosophical sensitivity that repays careful (re-)reading, and brimming with suggestive ideas that could well move the debate into some relatively unexplored terrain. (We should expect nothing less from a volume edited by Kane, who has himself long advocated the importance of approaching the ancient problem of free will from novel directions.) What's more, the collection includes essays from several philosophers whose own books on free will are, though quite important and valuable, somewhat cost prohibitive. (Anyone living on a graduate student's salary who's tried to pick up a copy of Pereboom's or Clarke's or Double's or Strawson's books will know what I mean.) So the expense of the present volume is, when seen in that light, thoroughly justifiable. In fact it's a steal! Or so I've tried to convince my wife.Finally, with his characteristic combination of clarity and rigor, Kane provides a lengthy introduction to the book that will help both the professional philosopher and the new-comer find their bearings in this complex debate with as little intellectual turmoil as can reasonably be hoped for. The book is a good one, highly recommended."

Erickson,18/19,5.0,1105315200,Kane's Compilation Will Leave You Proud To Lose An Argument,"I first encountered Bob Kane's skill with the daedal discipline of free will in his book *The Significance of Free Will.* At that time, I realized that Kane had an almost suspicious talent for articulating my own objections, and then articulating a response that would often satisfy me more than my own.While such a talent may be a bit threatening for readers aiming to claim their own victories, Kane's affability and enthusiasm always leave the reader not only with the necessary knowledge, but with a sense of pride in having participated in his well-authenticated jaunts.This work, in particular, highlights Kane's skills as both an original author and an editor with an honest eye for the best arguments of his opponents. It will certainly become a staple, if it has not already, for professional scholars of free will and curious by-standers alike. The *Oxford Handbook of Free Will* draws together balanced selections from the most relevant authors in the field, and-despite its depth-manages to cover a range broad enough that the book would be equally well placed on the shelves of theologians, philosophers, and physicians.My main criticism is that the compilation elides some selections that, to me, seem indispensable. Then again, such a problem *should* be inevitable for a field as factious as free will, and is blunted by Kane's need to balance his equations.The Oxford group has again demonstrated their wisdom in selecting Kane as the editor of this volume. Compared to its competitors in the prosy pantheon of free-will texts, this selection will leave you energized to gnaw through the next puzzle (rather than feeling deflated by the fact that there remain more arguments to be broached).-Christian P.

However, I am a very disappointed Romanian with this book and would never use it as my reference. I have seen travel guides outlining Europe exclude Romania before, but with the precision and detail of DK's series, I was left yet again in disappointment."

We then decided to expand overseas.Having to plan for a trip to Europe, we searched for a guide that would provide what we needed. The ""Eyewitness Travel Guides"" offered a total package. Good maps, photos, recommended places to see, dine, and stay. It's well-organized and relatively small. We brought it on the tours of France and Italy. It served us well, allowing us to find and decide what to see fairly readily. A friend just borrowed it and they said the same thing. It really aided their decisions and provided a reliable course of action. We plan to buy the other series for other locations. That should speak for itself."

131,0789480662,Eyewitness Travel Guide to Europe,,A3CP1WGNTOSKDA,"Tim Naff ""Tim""",1/1,5.0,1278115200,A Superlative Planning Aide and Top-level Guide,"This book was tailor made for our trip, which was for 3 weeks, hitting 8 major cities. It was useful for planning as well as a take-along guide. We traveled by train, and the book was great for ""getting our heads in the game"" for the next stop. The pictures are rich with detail, including cut-away views of many historical structures like castles and cathedrals. The historical synoptic narratives are extremely well written, delivering maximum information in the space available. The quality of the paper is impeccable, with a glossy finish and gorgeous colors.My 13-year old daughter, unexpectedly and unprompted, devoured the book during the train rides. She set aside her DVD player and forty or so movies, and focused on the book - day, after day, after day. She never watched a movie on the trains. When she finished studying the section on our next city, she moved outward in the book to other features of the country. She would go back and forth between the various city descriptions, the country maps, and the map of Europe. We would go into museums, and she would point out pictures she had seen in the book. Eventually, she had carefully looked over every page of the book and read far more than just what was relevant to our destinations. She probably reread the section on Anne Frank 10 times, even though we didn't get to Amsterdam and she has already read two books on the subject. Tomorrow morning, a Saturday with me off work, she and I are going to sit down together and go through the book, tabbing the sections that cover places we went. At the expense of sounding schmaltzy, I expect it will be a sentimental keepsake for the rest of her life.This is a great book for early planning, especially if you haven't decided on which cities to visit. On the other hand, if you've already made up your mind and you are visiting fewer than four cities, this is probably not the book for you - you wouldn't buy an encyclopedia if you only wanted to read three articles. Buying the book early can give you time to buy a more focused book for cities where you find you need more information.The binding on the book will appear somewhat unusual if you're unfamiliar with this publisher as I was. Sitting on a bookshelf, it looks like a hardbound book in a colorful dust jacket, even though there is no removable jacket at all. In fact, it is sort of a hybrid between a paperback and a hardbound book. The cover is actually vinyl: solid but flexible and looks and feels almost like it is plastic coated. The cover extends above and below the pages like a hard cover. One negative is that it is fairly heavy for a relatively small book. This is because of the 800, full-color, glossy pages in a book that is less than 1.25 inches thick. The other dimensions are roughly 8.5 X 5.25.I'm sorry, but I've got to take a shot at some of the negative reviews. Some criticized a lack of depth. What do you expect with 20 countries covered in 800 pages and content split between pictures, historical narrative, and touring advice that gets all the way down to restaurants and shopping? This book is a careful compromise between breadth and depth. (Our next trip will be to only three cities, and we'll buy more focused books then.) Frankly, I don't see how the publishers could have crammed more information into such a compact space. To the fellow who said the only Eastern European country covered was Czechoslovakia: (1) it's the Czech Republic, and (2) are Hungary and Poland not part of Eastern Europe? To the person who said the maps were not useful, I have to point out that maps that can actually help navigation typically can't fit on pages this small. What do you want, 200 foldout maps in an 800 page book?BTW, we brought along a set of maps that we had bought online. Surprisingly to us, we ended up mostly relying on the free ones available in the three, four, and five star hotels we stayed in. We never failed to get a good map from a hotel front desk or concierge. Even after all the preliminary study (also, my wife and I had been to most of the cities before), we often asked for suggestions on sites and several times made some new discoveries that way. We brought along a Garmin GPS, but used it very little because we were on foot, and the Garmin instructions used street names while the streets were often unmarked. (Try looking on the sides of buildings for street names.)Bottom Line: You are investing a significant amount of money, time, and sweat equity in your trip. While it isn't cheap as books go, in the greater context of trip expenses, this book is practically free. Probably the most significant cost is the weight allowance it eats up. (Put it in your carry-on; the airlines haven't started weighing those yet.) In the uses that I've described, it can significantly enhance your experience. When you get back, it will look good on your bookshelf. If you are still deciding on which cities to go to, or if you are going to more than a few cities, buy this book. You'll thank yourself, again and again, just as I thanked my wife.Bon voyage ..... buon viaggio ..... ibuen viaje ..... and, lest we forget, ..... gute fahrt!"

Derecola ""wasadz""",1/1,5.0,1172448000,Good Overall Idea,"I really like the eyewitness guides, I have seven including ""Europe"". All of them have tons of images, walking routes throught various cities, contact information for sites, hotel listings, resturants, and in many cases floor plans of museums and other buildings. I also like the fact that they give some history of the country, show images of the currancy, list suggested times to visit very busy sites and show some of the reasons why you would select to visit particular attractions.True this book does not cover all of Europe, but it does have sections on the more ""popular"" travel destinations. It is good if you want some general information on many different countries and to help determine which you have interest in visiting. It is not to large to carry around and has extended cover flaps to help mark the section.The last thing is that if you are traveling to only one country or going to spend a most of your time in one city, look for the individual eyewitness guides. The information in the Ireland book was better for the two week visit to Ireland, where this book (the Europe book) would have been only ok for that trip, but was perfect for the three days in Edinburgh and helping to select which countries to visit when we only had time for a few days in each."

Hadley,72/72,4.0,1090540800,Colourful Digest Of Places To See In Europe,"I bought this book to help me plan my trip to Europe and it was so useful, it was the only book I packed to take on my trip. The book covers mainly Western Europe along with Poland, Czech Republic, Hungry, and Greece. The former Soviet Union, former Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovakia are not covered and neither are the islands of Iceland, Malta, and Cyprus. Similarly, of the ""tiny"" countries, only Monaco and the Vatican are mentioned; Liechtenstein, Andorra, and San Marino are not.The book describes what is available to see in Europe. For each country, about six to twenty cities/regions are discussed and for major cities (e.g. London, Paris, Amsterdam, Venice, etc.) there is more detailed coverage, such as six to twenty sights within that city along with a city map. Usually, each attraction gets about a four-paragraph write-up plus a photograph. A few major attractions (e.g. Louvre, British Museum, St. Peter's Cathedral, etc.) are devoted two to four pages plus a larger diagram. Also, each country usually has another dozen or so pages covering its history and culture as well as a discussion about practical information such as climate, banking, methods of travel, shopping, etc.The book doesn't teach you everything you need to know about Europe (e.g. nothing about foreign languages), or will want to know (e.g. hotels, restaurants, and food have modest coverage). Nor does it include everything you'll do - only places, not events, are written about (e.g. Oktoberfest only warrants a photo). But the book does an excellent job at detailing what popular, famous, interesting, or important places there are in Europe. The pictures and illustrations make the book come to life. The maps help you judge the relative positions of sights within a particular city. The descriptions are usually detailed enough so you can determine how interesting you'll find a particular place. Some people might criticize the book because it doesn't judge how ""good"" each sight is. However, I find this nice because everyone has different tastes and I like to have the opportunity form my own opinions.If you want to know what is available to see in Europe then this is the book for you."

Get this book!,"If you're already a fan of the Eyewitness Travel Guide series, you know what to expect from this book. If this is your first time, let me tell you you'll be amazed with how great and how useful this book is.This particular guide summarizes the contents of over 20 other books by DK, including information for 20 countries in total, organized in the following way:- The British Isles (Great Britain &amp; Ireland)- France and the low countries (France, Belgium, Luxembourg &amp; The Netherlands)- The Iberian Peninsula (Spain &amp; Portugal)- Italy and Greece- Germany, Austria and Switzerland- Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway, Denmark &amp; Finland)- Central and Eastern Europe (Czech Republic, Hungary &amp; Poland).This guide contains, for every country, information regarding sites to visit, hotels, restaurants, shopping, museums, travel info (how tos for travelling by train, bus, car, metro, etc). Worthy of notice are their trademark cutaways of castles and churches, maps and street-by-street graphics.The only drawback is that since it includes information on so many countries, some of it might not have the detail you'd expect. For example, the France section has only 73 pages, while the Eyewitness Travel Guide to Paris (another book from DK) has over 350 pages on Paris alone!A phenomenal guide if you're planning on visiting many countries on one trip, but if you intend to dedicate more time to just a couple, you'd be better off getting the specific country/city guides."

It is more than likely not a guide you want to carry around with you unless you intend to lose a few pounds from the extra weight in your backpack. Otherwise, it is quite a great guide for deciding where you want to take your next vacation in Europe. It is filled with color photography, illustrations and details you wil enjoy reading. It is graphically exciting and visually pleasing. Of all the guides I've seen, the Eyewitness Travel Guides are sheer brillance.On the inside cover there is a map of Europe and then the pages are color coded so you can find the following countries: Great Britian, Ireland, France, Belgium & Luxembourge, The Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.So, if you wanted to find the information on France, you just turn the book sideways and look for the yellow markings on the pages. Viola, you are there. If you are dreaming about visiting the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre or want to go see the Hall of Mirrors at the Chateau de Versailles, may I say...they are worth a plane ticket to France. Finding a bottle of Huile D' Olive in the South of France is also something you won't soon forget.There is also a guide to Europe's Rail Network and the Index is perfect.After you look through the main spots to visit in each country, there is a section filled with practical information: Visa Requirements and customs, tourist information, personal security issues, climate, banking, communications, directory for embassies, travel information like car rental and buses, etc. Then there is a shopping and entertainment. So where do you want to stay? There is a guide giving the hotel ratings and it is divided up by the areas you might enjoy visiting. Then, there is a guide to places to eat. While finding a restaurant just by exploring can be exciting, there is something to be said for a guide. Unless of course you happen to be traveling with someone who knows the country and I can imagine that is the best way to travel. Is there a lonely Frenchman out there who wants to show me Paris? SighJust kidding, but hey, a fantasy is a fantasy.So, think of this guide as an overview and then you can select an Eyewitness Travel Guide for the specific countries of interest. They are all excellent although on a first trip to Europe, I'd advice a guided tour so you can enjoy your trip instead of worrying about language barriers, etc.If you go to Paris, take a tour because I would not drive there if you paid me a million bucks! The highways in Germany are also equally terrifying. Everyone is in such a hurry to get to nowhere. If you want to enjoy your vacation without as many hassles, a tour might be the way to go. There is nothing quite like being guided through the most gorgeous cities in Europe.This guide is just the start to many adventures.~The Rebecca Review"

ZAIDI ""Ali Zaidi""",11/13,4.0,1033689600,Helpful guide on tours through Europe,"I recently took a backpack trip through Europe, which lasted close to a month; before heading out there I went through a few guidebooks and at that moment this one appealed the most. I cannot say if it was the presentation with the colored photographs; maps of the cities with visitor information or that I was just to plain sick of spending time searching for a guide book to take me though my journey. Nonetheless I am quite pleased that I took this guide with me. I had planned initially to visit a friend in Netherlands and spend some time scrolling through the cities; I left my guide there to my host; but off and on I would reference the book with places I visited; I must admit that this book covered all the places. Now of course I personally feel the best way to visit a place is to have some one show you around as like any other travel guide will not detail the places where the locals would head over to; like the bars, restraunts and night clubs. My visit from here lead me to Paris; it hit me with all its charm and glamour; here too I was fortunate to be taken around by friends. The real use of the guide came when I went on a solo journey to Belgium Austria and Italy. I found this guide an immense source of information. On my way to the city mostly by trains; I found the chance to orient myself and somewhat have a time frame as to how long I would stay in each city. I found that even though the book has information about hotels and hostels but at the train station's Hotel Guides; I was always able to get better deals. Pretty much I carried this heavy 800 pages book with me where ever I went.Even though this book provides immense information I would highly recommend getting additional reference books on cities, which are known, for immense sightseeing and historical attractions. One such place where the guide fell short was Florence; even tough it has considerable information and provides all the most popular sites. It literally will take a 1000 pages to detail all the places to visit; as a comparison there are over 78 places to visit which have historical importance but the book has listed only about the best 14 of them; well visiting all the places would take a few weeks of stay in comparison to a typical 3-4 days that tourists generally spend; which is sufficient time to visit the places listed in the book. Another important place not mentioned in this test was the ""Museum of Arsenal"" in Vienna; here on display is the car in which duke Ferdinand traveled with in Sarajevo.On the whole this covers only the most western countries of Europe and leaves a lot of East European countries and Turkey as well."

Any archer's heart will race at the reaccounting of each hunt, but only archers of traditional caliber will be able to appreciate the flight of the arrow as it's loosed and hits its intended mark. The bond between fellow hunters is well expressed and gives proper account to the knowledge and wisdom passed down at the campfire by older more experienced hunters.

This is not a book an enthustiastic &quot;Wicca&quot; would be enjoyed or feel excited to read. Rather it is a well organized collection of historical accounts (mostly dealing with the &quot;Western&quot; side of the subject) and esoteric knowledge. Seligmann provides us a classified history of magic, beginning with ancient Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, Canaan and Greece; then shifts the main route towards the medieaval Europe. All sections concerning with ancient cultures has very interesting details on ancient rituals, myths and the concept of &quot;demons&quot;. He especially provides very interesting material on Hermetic philosophy and gnosticism. The hundreds of illustrations in the book, add an entertaining taste into the story. This book would have well deserved &quot;five stars&quot; if it included ancient Eastern beliefs and rites in same detailed style, so I rate Seligmann's work with 4 stars.

These are then followed an apology trying to explain why they really were worth quoting. It is a very boring read. Besides these stylistic annoyances, the entire structure of the book takes the form of a survey of various instances of pseudepigrapha... which are then dutifully stretched back to the initial lackluster thesis. There are no fantastic insights in this book. Unless you are doing a specialization in this field, I would not recommend buying this book. There are many better books in the study of religion to be savored. If you must have it for a specialization, I would recommend finding it at a university library... though it may have a limited availability since it is only a revamped standard doctoral thesis that is not widely applicable in many areas of study."

Every book on Hellenistic kingdoms or the Roman Empire presupposes (or should) interrelation of cultures because those political boundaries encompassed a variety of cultures. (A ""specialist"" should know this.) This text is just what it says: a chronicle of Homer and Moses citings.Second, other authors have expounded on this topic: they have, and they will again. I'm not going to explain in depth here because to do so would be to give away my doctoral thesis. I don't particularly want to see someone else take my sources, present my argument, and have my book published under his/her name.Third, it is extremely difficult to write a doctoral thesis, from my experience. So, while I cannot say that it is the best work on the topic, I think we should have sympathy for doctoral student writers. It is publish or perish, after all. At least it was published. I can only hope for so much for myself.Whether or not you the reader purchase this book is a matter of your own choice. Having to go back to the library for it too often is an indication that one is using it as a reference and not looking to the original sources. That is ill-advised.

First, in Williams, you have an intriguing, mysterious figure who not many people have much information on. Yes, he won the Heisman trophy and he is, publically, seen as a good person.What Richardson, the most respected college sports writer in the country, is able to do is look beyond the public perception and give readers a sense of what makes Williams tick and why Williams ticks the way he does.This book sets the stage for Williams in New Orleans. It is set before Williams' rookie year with the Saints and controversial coach Mike Ditka. After reading this book, you'll understand why Williams had the turbulent year and subsequent problems.Through a network of what seem to be unparalled contacts, Richardson is able to gain an insight on Williams the college player that has never before been exposed. He sets the table for Williams' rookie year. Much of the book explains how Williams was handled in college at Texas and why his transition to the real world has been so difficult.In short, this book is a must for any pro football fan. On a grand scale, it is much more than a work about Ricky Williams and the Saints. It chronicles the reasons college players have such a difficult time making the trasition to the professional level and explains why football is only part of that equation."

The goal of the book is to empower kids (and parents) to be responsible for their own feelings by identifying and handling them in appropriate ways.A variety of techniques are recommended depending on the age of the child and the child's own particular personality. (From art to music to reading to physical exercises and so much more).The author suggests that for each year of age a child has, they should develop that many coping mechanisms when they are upset for how to get their feelings under control and process them.This book strikes an excellent balance between the one extreme that says ""You have no business feeling that way - just deal with it"" which leads to stuffing emotions and angry outbursts, and the other extreme which focuses so much on talking about feelings ""You're angry, you're upset, tell me how you feel, let's focus on your feelings for hours ad nauseum"" that the child feels trapped by their own feelings and isn't given tools for moving beyond the situation.Highly highly recommend this book!

Some of these values, of course were not overtly stated...but most were understood.

The Farm had a fairly hierarchical structure compared to some hippie efforts, and identified as a spiritual community, with a large amount of group effort and work involved in basic infrastructure, social experiments, and, eventually, charity projects that were difficult for the cash-strapped group to support (like maintaining an ambulance service in besieged Bronx neighborhoods, hundreds of miles from the Farm home base in Tennessee, as well as projects in Central America during a guerrilla war that threatens local partners in the project).The stories are a FANTASTIC look at group dynamics and, in my opinion, give a great look at the consequences of the ""mission creep"" that idealistic projects such as nonprofits and religious organizations are prone to. Much of this is very entertaining, often in a black-humor sort of way, and gives a great look at commonalities in human nature that apply today, whether to today's version of 'hippies', or any hard-working and idealistic group of humans trying to better the world."

195,0887402216,The Battleship Bismarck,34.95,A30IUAABSEHEPI,Lawrence Duckles,9/9,3.0,1055980800,The Battleship Bismarck reviewed,"This book is both a history and a photo album of the famous German battleship, and the photos are particularly useful in showing both the construction stages of the ship and for the many interior shots. That said, this book has a couple of problems. One is its age; it was originally published in 1975, and the authors appear not to have taken advantage of the information that appears in Ludovic Kennedy's ""Pursuit,"" published the previous year. As a result, there are statements in this book, particularly concerning the Bismarck's chronology, that have been disproved by more recent discoveries. The other big problem is the translation, which appears to have been done very literally by someone with little knowledge of naval nomenclature. Thus, ""Seekriegsleitung"" gets translated as ""sea-war-leadership,"" which may be a literal translation, but ignores the more generic term ""naval operations,"" which is what this really means. This problem becomes particularly aggravating in trying to follow the time-line of events surrounding the destruction of the Hood and the Bismarck, which, as translated, make almost no sense. The diagrams, which are in German and are not translated, seem fairly accurate, although during the destruction of the Bismarck they appear to show the King George V firing torpedos at the Bismarck, when in fact the King George V had no torpedo tubes. It's also puzzling that the translator, according to the note at the end of the book, was unaware until 1989, with the publication of Robert Ballard's book on the discovery of the Bismarck, of the number of German sailors rescued after the sinking of the Bismarck. Even here, his figures are wrong--he states that 115 men were rescued by the British. In fact, British warships rescued 111 men (one later died and was buried at sea) while a German submarine and a German weather ship rescued the other five. A marginally useful book, although much of its information has been supersceded by more recent discoveries and research."

Barker demands faith and effort, but at its core, the method really does not differ much from techniques in cognitive therapy and sqaures with the latest views on neuroplasticity, at least in my view.

Allen owns one of the most successful software companies in the world, which now has made him the target of threats. The man sending threatening letters is obviously brilliant, unbalanced and dangerous. Concerned for his daughter, Alan wants someone to keep an eye on Prudence night and day to ensure her safety. But Micah must protect Prudence without her knowledge. She has struggled hard to establish her independence from her father and won't welcome his intrusion now, however well meaning.Micah moves into the apartment across the hall from Prudence, using his proximity to arrange quiet dinners and intimate moments. By necessity, Prudence believes he's courting her, and is confused by his mixed signal when he kisses her on one day and then emotionally distances himself the next. Micah is equally confused by his reactions, knowing that emotional involvement can endanger her safety. Prudence becomes the cause of some real soul searching, as their relationship takes a path he didn't expect. As danger escalates, Micah finds not just her life in danger, but his heart. Further, she won't be tolerant when she finds out her father hired him.Ruth Langan deftly combines danger and romance in BY HONOR BOUND. Langan has a gift for creating wonderful characters. The direct confrontation of the ethical issues provides striking characterizations with believable dilemmas. Her secondary characters likewise sparkle, from the Lassiter family to the meddlesome sisters that live in the same apartment building as Alan and Prudence. Unexpectedly delightful, BY HONOR BOUND comes highly recommended."

An elderly couple living on the island raised her and taught her to be self-sufficient. But now they are dead, and Tess is all alone on the island. She longs for human companionship but has learned to fear the world beyond the Isle of May. When a young Highlander washes ashore in a storm, Tess feels compelled to save him. At twenty years of age, Colin Macpherson is the youngest son of a Highland laird. He's been restlessly roaming the seas, but when he washes up on Tess's island, everything changes. As Colin helps Tess remember her past, he finds himself drawn to her as he's never been drawn to a woman before. And Tess is discovering strong feelings for him as well, feelings that may very well be love. But when they return to the mainland in search of Tess's heritage, will they be able to stay together, or will they be torn apart?Set in Scotland in 1543, this is my new favorite book in the Avon True Romance series.

When she finds a handsome young Highlander washed up on the shores of her island, she knows she must help him or he will die.As Tess and the handsome Highlander, Colin, spend time together waiting for a ship to come take him home, they form a friendship and discover that Tess is not so alone in the world as she thinks.This was a cute story, and definitely better than the last Avon True Romance (for teens) I picked up. It's the type of thing I would have swooned over as a teenager, had I deigned to read romances at that age (I admit, I had a bit of book snobbery going on, though I secretly loved any romance I could find in books I read). As an adult, now, I read the book and think it's cute. I would have loved to have seen how Tess and Colin's relationship matures as they do, but that is beyond the scope of this book and the age range it is intended for. I will probably be searching out McGoldrick's adult romance novels, though, given the promise this one held."

But compared to Caplan, Breggin, and Szasz, this is the most sensible critique I've seen. Usually, in the anti-psychiatry literature one finds inexcusible nonsequiturs. For example: ""Psychiatrists often don't realize that the medication is causing the disorder (good point). Therefore, biological psychatry is unsound (bad point)."" Or ""Psychiatric illnesses are voted on by committee (good point), therefore there is no such thing as mental illness (bad point)."" Walker avoids making such obvious nonsequiturs. Far from being against biological psychiatry, Walker argues that current psychiatry is not biological enough. It appeals to highly hypothetical conditions (such as neurotransmitter disorders) while ignoring known conditions (such as pin worms or hypothyroidism). Some might think that this is all that Walker is saying, but his general point seems to be that since psychiatrists are taught to run through symptoms lists instead of being medical detectives, there a lot of unknown conditions which they are failing to discover."
240,0471192627,"A Dose of Sanity: Mind, Medicine, and Misdiagnosis",30.0,,,12/13,4.0,893203200,Fascinating and Terrifying,"Dr. Walker's book is a stern indictment of the contemporary medical profession and the mental health field in particular. He charges the majority of psychiatrists of ignoring the true needs of their patients and instead practicing and arbitrary pseudo-science of labeling. They seem to have given up on the idea (fundamental to the philosophy of science)that all events have a cause and that to understand something we must understand the process of cause and effect that brought it into being. Most modern psychiatrists are not interested in finding out what is wrong through careful methodology. They are divided into two camps. The psychoanalytic types deny a medical cause for abnormal feelings and behaviour altogether (however, they still want the prestige that comes with being a medical doctor!). They look everything from a bad childhood to alien abductions to explain such things as psychosis and manic depression, even though no scientific study has ever proven the theories on which their claims are based. The next group, the standard issue biopsychiatrists are a little more up to date. They would admit the obvious scientific truth that someone who hears voices or is immobilized by a deep depression is psysically ill. However, they drop the ball as well. Most biologically based psychiatrists give very vague answers about the causes of mental illness, and rely on a few biological treatments which are tried on the patient almost randomly until one seems to &quot;work&quot;. For instance, a depressed person will be given one antidepressant drug after another without the doctor even stopping to consider that the deprssion may result from anemia, a thyroid imbalance, poor nutrition or a host of other causes. Many psyciatric patients today are not even given a blood test, an EEG or any other genuine medical test before traetment is prescribed. Walker points out that until people are given a battery of tests, we will never really know what is wrong with them. Prozac or tranquilizers may make the! m feel better temporatily, but they could be literally dying. He also attacks the concepts of hypochodndria and facetious disorder. For the most part, he argues, these are destructive labels used to protect doctors and stigmatized patients (&quot;if I can't figure out what is wrong with you then it is all in you're head and/or you are just making it up&quot;) While I don't agree with all his points (for instance, his extreme anti-prozac position) I must say that this book is must reading for anyone in need of mental health care."
241,0471192627,"A Dose of Sanity: Mind, Medicine, and Misdiagnosis",30.0,,,9/11,4.0,983059200,"Informative, but left me wanting more","I was very impressed with A Dose of Sanity because so many books critical of psychiatry remind me of Breggin which claim that there is something &quot;spiritual&quot; missing in the patient, and the author ignores the bioligical problems inherent in the behavioral or mood disorder.However, I as I made my way through the book I was concerned that Dr. Walker was not going to address what to do if you have been diagnosed with a serious mood disorder, but were unable to find a physical cause (like a boy that was ADHD but had cardiac problems). I was right. He never said what to do if you have been diagnosed with manic depression (or any of the other hard to treat mood disorders). He did not address lithium or other non-antidepressant therapies for mood disorders. I agree that these treatments are probably only treating the symptoms of some underlying brain dysfunction that science has not yet named, but what does the patient do until science has figured this out? Remain psychotic? Lithium therapy may be some band-aid solution for a cellular dysfunction of our brain matter, but is a patient supposed to discontinue this medication because science can only offer this treatment to help the symptoms of the disorder? I wish Walker had offered an opinion and information on this issue.Also, along the same line, he didn't say what patients should do once they had gone through exstensive medical testing to determine their problem and nothing physically wrong was found. (Nevermind the fact that he did't give specific tests to ask for - just blood and urinalysis in addition to what else?) If you know that you don't suffer from pin worms, syphillis, typhus, cardiac problems or whatever else, but your symptoms only seem to match typical manic symptoms that only lithium helps, should you throw in the towel and accept the psychotropic medication?I do think that Dr. Walker is truly concerned about patients who have fallen victim to DSM &quot;diagnosis&quot;, and this book could be very helpful for a patient who has received psychiatric care, but did not have a full medical work-up before taking psychotropic medications. I only wish this book had touched on the issues that I mentioned above.Finally, the most important message of this book is never stop learning about what you have been told your disorder is, and never take the word of your doctor as law. As Walker says himself, there is no way that one doctor can know everthing about medicine."
242,0471192627,"A Dose of Sanity: Mind, Medicine, and Misdiagnosis",30.0,A18TBJTWXAFKBN,Mira de Vries,1/1,3.0,1310256000,Somatic medicine as an alternative to psychiatry?,"Walker's book rests on two main themes. One is that theDSM, in spite of its name, is not a diagnostic manual at all, but a catalogue of descriptive labels that serve as an excuse for abandoning further medical investigation. He calls the DSM ""a cookbook listing of symptoms that has replaced the science of differential diagnosis.""The other theme divides into two parts. The minor one is that many people who are slapped with DSM labels and prescribed psychotropic drugs have nothing at all medically wrong with them.The major theme, however, and the main theme of the book next to criticism of the DSM, is that almost all cases of serious aberrations of feelings or behavior stem from physical causes such as genetic disease, hormonal imbalances, toxins, infection, parasites, and tumors. The DSM encourages psychiatrists to be lazy and overlook these causes, he says. Psychotropic drugs only mask them, and do more harm than good. Psychotherapy, including psychoanalysis, are totally useless for these conditions. Psychiatry should return to its true mission as practiced (according to Walker) by Emil Kraepelin and Benjamin Rush, namely to identify and treat the physical causes of insanity.I agree with Walker that cases of grossly aberrant behavior (as opposed to responses to stress) are probably due to unidentified physical causes. However, not identifying these causes is the failure of somatic medicine, not psychiatry. Psychiatry's mission has always been to sweep up after somatic medicine, and to sweep away society's rejects while it's at it.Walker maintains that there is a legitimate use of psychotropic drugs, but only in those extremely rare cases that the physical cause cannot be identified, or no curative treatment exists. My opposition to this contention is that far from being extremely rare, those are exactly all cases with which psychiatry deals. One of Walker's examples of physical disease which psychiatrists frequently fail to identify and treat is Tourette Syndrome, which he calls genetic. In spite of his own insistence that the causes of conditions should be scientifically sought, he fails to provide any evidence that TS is genetic in origin. Even if he had such evidence, since when does identifying conditions as genetic make them curable? On the other hand, Walker overlooks compelling evidence that TS is caused by brain damage: it is common in people whose brains have been damaged by psychotropic drugs. He doesn't mention how he thinks TS should be treated. In fact, the only ""treatment"" that exists, whether effective or not, is Haldol, the very type of treatment he claims to oppose except in those extremely rare cases, whichever they are.While correctly calling into question the efficacy and safety of psychiatric practice, Walker highly overrates somatic medicine. He attaches great diagnostic significance to gene mapping and brain scanning, whereas in reality such toys have as yet benefited no one but the doctors who employ them for research.One of Walker's more bombastic claims for successful treatment of aberrant behavior is ... surgically cleaning cholesterol out of a patient's brain arteries! (Who would be so gullible as to believe that?)Interesting to note are Walker's views on two of the greats among opponents to psychiatry, Peter Breggin and Thomas Szasz.Walker duly credits Breggin with having called attention to the horrific harm done by psychiatric drugs. Unfortunately, according to Walker (and I agree with him on this) the flip side to Breggin is blaming serious dysfunctional behavior on ""bad parenting."" No, not such obvious bad parenting as battering children or trading them for cocaine, but vague failures that only Breggin himself can identify, like paying insufficient attention to children. Walker might have added that those parents who are likely to seek psychiatric services, not to mention pay big bucks for them (a subject on which Breggin never touches), are the very parents who are deeply devoted to their children. Walker also criticizes Breggin for blaming schools, though schools are very much known to contribute to the ill-being of children.Contrary to his position on Breggin, Walker showers praise on Szasz, particularly for having been the first and the most relentless critic of DSM fake diagnoses. However, he feels Szasz goes too far in denying there is ever a physical origin for dysfunctional behavior, and by suggesting that such people are actually ""incompetent, lazy, or bad."" He presumes that Szasz would leave them to die in the streets and in jails, overlooking the fact that Szasz is the only writer in the field who has suggested a practical solution for dealing with such people, namely the non-medical asylum, or as Szasz nicknames it, the ""adult orphanage.""Those of you who are interested in ""alternative psychiatry"" may be interested in Walker's views on such treatments. He does not reject the idea outright, though he considers most of them quackery and downright silly. Acupuncture he calls effective in treating pain - but not curing the cause of pain.Orthomolecular medicinecan treat nutritional deficiency, but nothing else, he says.Walker further criticizes judges' reliance on psychiatric expertise. He says nothing about it that Szasz hasn't said before him. He does not mention involuntary commitment anywhere in the book.Finally, Walker calls on us, potential psychiatric patients, to take responsibility for our own health care. That's fine advice, but limited by the fact that responsibility can be carried out only in freedom. Massive state intervention in medicine means that much of his otherwise excellent advice is impossible to follow.All in all, this book's power is the author's ability to state in layman's language why theDSMis a fraud.Copyright MeTZelf"

In King James: The LeBron James Story he does a great job of trying to show the reader how amazingly good LeBron James is at basketball. Coach Bob Gibbons said about LeBron's performance in the Olympic trials, ""I don't want to blow too much smoke and distort the kid's thinking, but I saw Kobe Bryant in tenth and eleventh grades, and I think this kid is more advanced than Kobe was."" Like LeBron, Kobe Bryant was drafted out of high school and has led the Los Angeles Lakers to multiple NBA Championships.Ryan Jones is editor-in-chief at SLAM, the monthly basketball magazine that combined the sport with hip hop culture at a time when the genre was becoming increasingly popular. The magazine carries advertising for basketball-related products, street-wear clothing and hip hop music, and it has been credited with helping to market hip hop culture and basketball as one. It is only fitting that Ryan Jones wrote his first national magazine feature on LeBron James. He thoroughly explains LeBron's involvement with SLAM magazine throughout the book. He lives in New York with his wife and son.Although Jones seems a bit repetitive at times, his knowledge of basketball and great style shines though and creates an easy to read biography. In Chaper Four, he talks about the potential LeBron possessed in football as well as basketball: even though ""there wasn't much national buzz on LeBron the football player, area football coaches knew better."" Jones even compares him to the New England Patriots Pro-Bowl wideout, Randy Moss. While he mainly focuses on LeBron's basketball ability, his information about LeBron's high school football career is refreshing.With all the hype about LeBron and his constant coverage on ESPN, this book reveals the truth about LeBron and his journey from moving in with his friend's family to his 90 million dollar sneaker deal with Nike. While the vocabulary can be a bit easy at times, the book a joy to read, especially if you are a total sports nut like myself. A stong strength of Jones is to tell the complete story of every little event in Lebron's life. His very descriptive writing explains aspects of basketball that makes this book a good pick for sports lovers and non sports lovers alike. I give this book an eight out of ten and recommend it highly."

He has a big story on how he got to the NBA. LeBron was very poor growing up; his father left him and his mother when he was young. LeBron had to live with friends so his mom could work to keep a roof over their heads. A cool thing I thought LeBron did is when he was signing autographs an adult pushed over a kid just to get LeBrons signature but LeBron said ""Let me sign the kids first"". I think this shows LeBrons care for kids.When LeBron was in High School at St.Vincent St.Mary, the spotlight was on him. LeBron took the Irish to the state championship all four years of High School. LeBron played Football and Basketball in High School. He could of gone to college to be a star Wide Receiver but he chose Basketball. LeBron won the Mr.Basketball in Ohio award all four years in High School. I loved this book because LeBron never gave up at what he wanted to accomplish.

This is an entertaining book to read and I reccommend it to anyone who is a fan of Lebron James or is interested in reading about the rising star. The author does a great job of telling how Lebron is on and off the court. After reading this book you will come to respect Lebron as a basketbal player and a person.

The objective was clearly to tell LeBron James story, and the author does so fluidly and intelligently. The only issue I had when it came out was if LeBron warranted an entire book. Given that he's spent the first three quarters of his rookie season proving he may have even be underrated, consider the book warranted. So, basketball fans, if you want to know the real LeBron James story before it gets changed or distorted by the corporations that are soon to be even more involved in his life, check out this book and you'll get all the background you need to be able to intelligently discuss the first superstar of the new millenium."

However, I found that a lot of the book read like a magazine article, given that the author usually writes for Slam magazine, this is no surprise. Still, it is interesting and entertaining.

286,B0006DWYDW,Building the timber frame house: The revival of a forgotten craft,,A2ROJNY48QN55E,Reviewer,4/4,5.0,1230422400,Nearly three decades old and more relevant than ever,"This book was first written in 1980, though the philosophies presented between its covers are appropriate in these recent years of speculative energy prices and wobbling economic foundations. Timber frame house construction was ""green"" before that word was media-masticated and spit into popular culture.The book is well illustrated and instructive, and it is also well written. The authors have both experience and passion for this topic. The hand-drawn illustrations are well labeled with a drafting font that makes it interesting and captivating to read.The book begins with a historical review of this art, and slowly drills down to detailed diagrams of the many joining techniques. It is amazing that this old style of construction intuitively solved problems in structural mechanics without the need for finite element modeling, or even nails for that matter. The strength of this method of construction comes not from the size of the timbers (though they are substantial), but from the joints crafted from wood with axes, augers, and hammers. Timber framing is like cabinet building, but bigger.There are many detailed drawings of joining techniques, and the reader quickly realizes that the craftsmanship and careful execution of these joints is the secret to this respected building trade. Flipping through these pages also immediately reveals the compromises that are made in modern home construction. Those who have ever wondered where the term ""stick built"" comes from will find the answer in this book. Dimensional lumber are sticks in comparison to timbers. Though metal connectors used in today's framing have done wonders for total structural stability, this book shows you that timber framing negates the need for stamped steel reinforcement.Timber framed structures are built for permanence, preserving the strength of the frame by encasing it completely within the outer sheathing and exploiting the timbers as an aesthetic interior design element. It is amazing that so many barns and houses were built only by hand, because a single timber required two or more men to lift and transport. In this age, a crane is more appropriate. One should keep this in mind if considering this project on his or her own.The captions in the book are terse and straight forward. ""Wood never lies to you."" ""You don't just hack away obliviously."" As said before, the writing is eloquent, and one can feel the earnestness of the writer with every paragraph. This excerpt sounds like it was written this year, rather than 1980:""To insulate as well as we can and to make houses as tight as we can present new challenges to the building industry. Houses will no longer naturally ventilate because of our inability to get them tight. We can lock them up like thermos bottles if we like. To bring new air into the house, we'll have to design ventilation systems into the plans. With heat loss cut to the bones, we'll have to design natural and mechanical recirculation to keep the temperature even and the air fresh. In this kind of environment, the heat from appliances, lights, and even body heat will contribute significant proportions to the small heating requirements. In houses built this way, energy from the sun, wind, or water could easily replace fuel-fired power sources.""""Energy conservation is the hope of the future. In conscience, we must mark the end of the era of substandard housing that is cheap to build but expensive and wasteful to maintain. In conscience, we should begin a time when houses contain energy-autonomous environments that consume no fossil fuels and are build to last centuries.""Those words are nearly three decades old. They are describing what is sometimes called a ""passivhaus"" or ""passive house"", which is also an established building technique but is only recently seeing revival as a ""green"" building technique. Insulation, rather than expensive heating and cooling systems, is the key to energy efficiency. What the authors are showing is that with a timber frame, the outer skin can be insulated panels that are tightly sealed, making a water tight and nearly air tight structure that is stronger, more permanent, and more energy efficient than any home constructed from dimensional lumber.And if there is any gripe of the book, it is that there should be more detail on the outer sheathing and insulating techniques, as well as wiring methods. There are a few cross sections (fairly detailed) but they are not as comprehensive as other sections of the book. Perhaps in 1980 the insulated panel industry was not large enough to devote more than a few pages to it. But now, there are composite, structurally insulated panels of many varying types that can be used in conjunction with a timber frame to build a very efficient, very strong, and architecturally pleasing home. And this is yet another example of how things come full circle; one of the oldest building techniques proves itself to be superior to its modern replacement in multiple ways.On a personal note my building experience comes from the construction of a stick built garage which, at the time, seemed incredibly stout to me. I used 2x6 lumber for the walls rather than 2x4s, and sheathed the walls and roof with 5/8"" oriented strand board. I used metal connectors in liberal amounts, reinforced the joints and ceiling joists, and insulated the entire structure so that I could work during the cold months. The garage is a solid, well insulated structure that maintains a comfortable climate by insulation and thermal mass alone. I was striving for a better way of building, and after reading this book I see that my desire was for timber frame construction. I wish I would have known more about it when I undertook the garage project, but now if I ever build my own home, I know how I will build it.Lastly, the appendix has diagrams for beam loads that is nearly more comprehensive than some textbooks on the topic of strength of materials. Even if you do not intend to build a home this way, this book may still be of value to you if you have any interest in building, construction, or architecture.For more information on finishing a timber frame home with different structural insulated panel technologies, see Benson's newer book: The Timber-Frame Home: Design Construction Finishing. It has more color photos and addresses the special considerations for foundations, plumbing, wiring, and insulating timber frame homes."

302,B0007DQIIS,"The ancient constitution and the feudal law,: A study of English historical thought in the seventeenth century",,A2UIXU97JYCPZG,R. Albin,6/6,4.0,1259193600,Interesting,"An interesting early book by the great historian of ideas JGA Pocock. This book focuses on what Pocock calls the history of historiography in 17th century England. Pocock is concerned mainly with reconstructing how 17th century intellectuals thought about their past. This apparently recondite topic turns to have a number of interesting dimensions. Pocock begins with a surprising and interesting fact, that something prefiguring historical analysis emerged from the study of legal traditions. This occurred first in 16th century France, where the emerging methods of humanist textual criticism were applied to legal traditions. The existence of different legal traditions in France led several scholars to discover the dynamic quality of legal history, the discovery of feudalism, and reconstruction of legal history in the context of a form of social history. In England, where the common law tradition had no competitors, the evolution of knowledge followed a different course. The common lawyers, epitomized by the great Edward Coke, projected the common law and contemporary English political institutions back into an immemorial past as a permanent feature of English life. This treatment of English legal history was entangled in efforts to resist James I assertions of royal power.Subsequent scholars, notably the great antiquarian Henry Spelman, partly inspired by French scholars, subsequently discovered the changing nature of English law, discovered feudal law, and made inferences from legal history to imaginative and insightful reconstructions of medieval English society. Pocock evinces particular symppathy for Spelman's efforts to elucidate non-anachronistic understandings of key terms and concepts, an activity very similar to Pocock's own scholarly goals. Pocock traces the influence of Spelman's discoveries on subsequent scholars and how these reconstructions of English history were entangled in 17th century politics. This book concludes with a nice chaper on the treatment of English history following the Glorious Revolution, describing the emergence of the Whig version of English history and looking forward to the work of important 18th century historians like Robertson and Hume.Like of all of Pocock's work, this book is characterized by close analysis of the texts, Pocock's impressive erudition, and clear writing."

Newman ""Bob Newman""",9/9,5.0,953510400,Tales of the world I never knew and never will,"Thanks to my grandparents, who came to America in the first decade of the 20th century, I grew up and have had a good life. Thanks to my grandparents, I didn't become a piece of ash or a few tossed out bones in an Eastern European field at the age of 2. Wars are wars; they've occured throughout human history, but in most of them, whole civilizations didn't disappear. But the Eastern European Jewish world is gone forever. I might belong to the same gene pool, but compared to the characters in Isaac Bashevis Singer's stories, I'm as American as apple pie. Irish-Americans can discover their roots in Ireland, Chinese-Americans in China, and so on, but not me. My cultural roots are gone forever. The only way I can learn them is through reading literature written by Singer, Shalom Aleichem, Isaac Babel and others who describe that vanished world. So, obviously, my interest and pleasure in reading such wonderful tales as appear in THE SEANCE and OTHER STORIES is all the more. Never mind my personal reasons. These amazing stories, by a Nobel Prize winner, will stay with you for a long time. The strange, sad characters afflicted by poverty and by life, bring us face to face with common human personalities of all times and places, while also depicting the conditions and peculiar relationships of Jews in Poland too. Magic, religion, animals, thieves, rabbis, prostitutes, mystics, Holocaust survivors, Talmudic scholars, prisoners, books, butchers and shopkeepers crowd the pages. In each story, you find pathos and tragedy, happiness and satisfaction, tensions and transformations. Two of the stories, ""The Seance"" and ""The Letter Writer"" must rank with the best stories I have ever read; none of the others are bad. If you have never read Singer, this is an excellent book to start with. If you have, you know what I am talking about. This is the great writer at the top of his form."

The various collections in the end also earned him a very well deserved Nobel Prize for literature in 1978. Several of his stories were first published in magazines like The New Yorker, Encounter and Playboy. The first collection I read was Passions and Other Stories, which immediately made me realise what a master Isaac Bashevis Singer was. Later I have read several of his novels and short stories, where especially the collections Gimpel the Fool, Short Friday and The Seance are at least as good as Passions. All a magnificent world of Isaac Bashevis Singer's saints and sinners. Sad, funny, ironic, poignant and seeming to come from Singer's pen without any efforts. This is what good short stories is all about!"

Singer wrote primarily in Yiddish, and the 16 short stories here have been translated into English by various translators, though overseen by the author.Singer's stories are invariably set among Jewish communities, the majority in the Polish Jewish villages of the late Russian Empire, though three are set in the postwar United States. Readers of this collection should have a basic knowledge of Jewish customs, for example, what a mezzuzah is. Still, behind the trappings of culture, the characters are universal and anyone will recognize themselves and their acquaintances here. At times, however, Singer is more interested in allegory than realism, and the characters represent the Jewish people. Singer's depiction of Polish Jewish life is not a nostalgic reminisce of some purer age, and the frankness of Singer's themes is remarkable. The subject of ""Yanda"" is a provincial prostitute, while ""Zeitl and Rickel"" describes the doomed lesbian romance of two pious girls.Found by chance in a ""take a book, leave a book"" pile, THE S&Eacute;ANCE AND OTHER STORIES was my introduction to this Nobel laureate. While I'm not so bowled over by the stories to want to seek out other works by this author, the material is consistently entertaining (the 200 pages are a quick read) and some of the endings memorable."

311,B0006D6DRK,"Open marriage;: A new life style for couples,",,A1IMB8FTTTJN12,parnassus2,16/18,5.0,1162425600,"title refers to open communication and self examination, not swinging","Please don't be confused by the unfortunate choice of title, nor by the ridiculous books promoting promiscuity that are associated with it by Amazon databases.Let's examine the two negative reviews of this book.One reviewer admits that he had decided the book wasn't worthwhile before reading it, and proceeds with an attitude that dares the authors to change his mind. This is hardly an ""open"" reading, is it? Further, the message of this book is in no way negated by a supposed divorce between the authors. The authors of Open Marriage specifically instruct readers to examine their expectation that marriage lasts forever.Another reviewer has a vested interest in dismissing Open Marriage, because its ideas contradict those of a book he wrote. He is careful to advertise his own book in his negative review of Open Marriage.As for whether Open Marriage is outdated, since when did such things as communication and trust become outdated? With extremes of ideology and dogma on a rapid increase, a book that promotes careful examination of our assumptions and expectations before getting married has never been more relevant. Has Socrates' dictum ""An unexamined life is not worth living"" ever gone out of date?Briefly, I'll quote from chapter 4:""The guidelines [to healthy relationships] are as follows:1 realistic expectations2 privacy3 open and honest communication4 flexibility in roles5 open companionship6 equality7 identity8 trustWhere do love, sex, and fidelity fit in? Are these not guidelines too - the basic components of any marriage? Important, yes; guidelines, no. Many of the problems with the closed marriage [defined by poor communication, lack of trust, immaturity etc.] stem from a false concept of the part that love, sex, and fidelity play in the relationship between man and a woman. The guidelines of open marriage listed above form the basis upon which love, sex, and fidelity achieve their meaning, not vice versa. If personal identity is based on love, equality measured by sex, and trust defined by fidelity, then identity will be crushed by a lessening of the initial romantic fervor, equality diminished by a temporary failure in sex, and trust destroyed through even the appearance of infidelity. But if personal identity, equality and trust exist in full measure, then the normal fluctuations that occur in any relationship between two human beings can be taken in stride.""One way of looking at the book Open Marriage is to say that the authors are discussing which comes first, the chicken or the egg? They are revealing that love, sex, and fidelity are outcomes of mature relating, thus not the cause of mature relating. If we reverse causation and pursue the product directly, without the process, than we set in motion a degradation from expectation, to demands, to manipulation, to frustration, and ending in ""bitter disappointment"" (chapter 4). For example, suspicious jealousy pursues fidelity directly, bypassing the process of building trust and commitment. On the other hand, when we follow the above 8 principles of healthy relating, the likely outcome is love, and fidelity. I recall a TV Sitcom in which a holiday family reunion wasn't going well, and someone angrily threatened that ""we all had better start having fun right now!"" Again, pursuit of the outcome directly without the process, results in our realizing the very thing we most fear (can you hear echoes of Dr. Phil McGraw in this?)The authors are saying that an unexamined marriage will fail because our unconscious assumptions, demands, and expectations are going to take over, and a great deal of negative conflict will result. These authors are simply saying that we need to pay attention and be proactive, examine our thoughts and feelings openly, and negotiate a mutually acceptable relationship. This open communication and cooperation, as opposed to conflict, is what the authors refer to in the title of their book. They are referring to a Socratic openness to challenging one`s own thoughts and behaviors as a basis of healthy living. This point is strongly supported by Dr. M. Scott Peck, author of The Road Less Traveled, who refers to Open Marriage on page 93 of ...Traveled. Dr. Peck's says the same thing with a different metaphor: we ought to examine our mental ""maps"" and be willing to revise them to keep ourselves dedicated to reality. Let Dr. Peck's reference carry more weight than mine."

Rather, the authors examine the problem of what another author has called ""the couple front,"" where couples feel they must act as if they're surgically joined, & end up feeling confined & eventually hating each other.If you are NOT interested in nonmonogamy, then read ANY book by Harville Hendrix & you'll find thoughts that are much more practical.If you ARE interested in nonmonogamy (group marriage, polyamory, etc.), then start with Intimate Friendships (Ramey), Polyamory (Ravenscroft -- whoops, that's me), Polyamory (Anapol), Honest Sex (Roy & Roy), or Group Marriage (Constantine & Constantine)... or even The New Faithful (Nearing), or Three in Love (Foster).I usually see ten copies of this book at any thrift store.

By this logic, is monogamy null and void, because monogamous people divorce? No type of relationship--straight, gay, monogamous, polyamorous, etc--is guaranteed against breakup. There are also horrendous relationships that are together forever because of desperation or beliefs. Even if there is a higher percentage of breakup in a certain relationship style, is ""together until death"" the only measure of a valid relationship?As many people pointed out, ""open marriage"" back then didn't mean specifically what it does now. In this book it means communicating openly, treating each other as equals, and allowing each other personal freedom. Most of this book is about how to get along better in a relationship by remembering that you both are individuals. You don't have to do everything together or have everything in common. You don't have to give up separate interests that your partner doesn't share. You don't have to give up friends when you get married. Giving up things like that don't make couples closer; they make couples resent each other and also take away their outside support systems.They mention non-monogamy as a possibility if both partners agree to it. They mention that depending on the context, sex with another person may not be the most horrible betrayal in a marriage (I said, depending on context. There are plenty of times it is a major betrayal.) Specifically I remember the passage about ""the grass is always greener"", and how with no fence, there is less of that feeling.My criticism of the ""love and sex without jealousy"" chapter is they talk about not having jealousy, but aren't very specific about how to deal with it and how to overcome it. (There are other books on open relationships that go into more detail about that.)Another criticism is that at times it relies on a premise of both people having careers that allow for economic independence. A career like that is not available to all people; there is no reason that only people with good careers should be able to have good relationships.There are lots of self-help books that promise a ""one and only way"" to have a satisfying relationship if you follow some off-the-wall advice, including the ""emotional infidelity"" variety that do advise couples to avoid friends and spend all of their time together. This book, in comparison, is common sense. Whether you want to be monogamous or non-monogamous, I think this book provides practical advice that should be elementary, but often isn't."

It moves away from the abstract, dualistic ideas of God that are grounded in Greek philosophical and pagan concepts. T. F. Torrance describes in detail where these ideas originated from and how they often threatened the integrity of the gospel. The churches in the first few hundred years were forever challenged with concepts and ideas that had no grounding in Scripture and tradition. By contrasting Jesus Christ as the centre for all our understanding about who God is and what God does against false concepts, Torrance very effectively shows how the church today has lost this vital focus. I would consider this book to be a masterpiece in bringing the cosmic reality of the gospel in the person and work Jesus Christ to a shocking and utterly staggering degree.

But the reader is supposed to believe that good Mary has an evil twin who did the killings...I read the ending of the novel several times to see if it was communicating to the reader that the bad Mary was just the evil side of Mary B., i.e. she has a split personality.

That is one reason the new book by Mary Getten, a Naturalist specializing in the wildlife of the San Juan Islands and a practicing animal communicator is so brilliant. This is not for folks who think that actual communication with whales (or other critters) is impossible. Those folks are probably the same people who get angry at their dogs for not doing what they are told.Mary herself was once a skeptic, as she relates in ""Communicating with Orcas: The Whales' Perspective"". At her first animal communication workshop, facilitated by Penelope Smith, Mary was given the task to communicate with Pirouette, Penelope's cockatiel:""I knew nothing about birds. Mammals were my passion, and I had nointerest in delicate little avians. Truthfully, I was a little frightened of them, yet here I was face to face with a cockatiel and it was time for us to talk.I looked into her bright white face, admiring the crest of yellow feathers on her forehead and the orange dot on her cheek. Drinking in her features, I relaxed and thought, this won't be too tough. She seems nice enough. So I began to think about what to say to her.This is where it all went downhill. I didn't have a clue what to say to a bird. You would have though that I'd spent my entire life locked into a closet. Not a single question appeared. Time ticked by and I knew I had to so something, so I kept repeating: ""Hello Pirouette. Hello Pirouette. Hello Pirouette.""Finally, I stopped for a moment to think of something else to say, and clear as a bell I heard Pirouette say: ""Can't you say anything but hello?""Humor, backed with good science and historical tidbits going back to Aristotle and Pliny The Elder balance the presentation for those who are a little reticent to believe in this mode of communication. (This skepticism persists even in the wake of breakthrough research by famed scientist Rupert Sheldrake.) Mary's writing is clear and accessible and the stories of whale sex are quite funny. I mean laugh-out-loud, drool on the PAGE funny.Yet, the skepticism that Mary had when first learning to communicate with animals is the book's biggest weakness, in my view. I was fascinated by the notion of Ruffles, the male elder of the Southern Puget Sound resident community's J Pod, visiting the dreams of schoolchildren who had been on whale-watching cruises. The notion that our species, the lowly Homo sapiens, is at the beginning of a new wave of consciousness that will see remarkable innovations in bodies and senses, or that of the whale councils, the ability to live in past lives (though whales don't call them that) and their description of the universal life force as ""The Prime Cause,"" are all subjects that fascinate me, but the book only teases with these concepts. Perhaps a sequel is called for.However, these are pretty far-out concepts for the average reader and when it comes down to it, Mary has covered the basics in a thorough manner with a wicked wit. If you have the least bit of interest in Orcas, you will be able to read this book in a weekend.May we all be able to live in the moment like these whales have for thousands of years. Their intelligence is much needed in these days when our allegedly more intelligent species, can't get beyond such insanity as war and environmental degradation.Paul Nelson"

Granny is a 92 (est.) year-old orca who lives in the Pacific Northwest with her family, J Pod. During Mary and Raphaela's time conversing with Granny, they question her on many aspects of orca life from finding food to orca spirituality. Granny relays a very important message to the human race in this book. A message that MUST NOT be overlooked! This book should be read and emabraced by all.

After reading the first few pages I found that I could not put this book down until I had finished reading it. This book is awesome, entertaining, witty, and written from a totally unique whale's perspective which can not help but captivate you. Communicating with Orcas is skillfully presented to communicate points that Granny wishes to make about the life of whales, her profound observations of the human race, and the essential roll that the whales play in raising the consciousness of the earth. Before reading this book, I would never have entertained the idea that communication with a whale or any other animal for that matter could indeed be possible. One has to be able to accept that things do exist that are not readily proven or explained by Newtonian scientific theories. The insight provided in this book will truly astound you. Many past cultures had a closeness to nature that has been lost in today's world. This book takes a refreshing step back into what was and is still possible if we are open to believing"

Little did I realise I was actually getting a narative about a woman who says she can telepathically communicate with animals.Now, don't get me wrong. I have done research into the telepathic Animal Communication, even as a freshman in college right now I have done more research into it. And even though there seems to be something, I have yet to see a bonified scientific study followed by a scientific peer reviewed paper on these experiences people have. And even as a person going into a minor Psychology I know that Psychological and behavioral studies are very difficult, becuase of the amazing amount of variables that are caused by the extremely complex brain, alone. But even I can not take much of this at face value.I believe her, I don't think she is lying. I question the validity of the actual communication. Is she really linking mentally to this orca, or is this her not fully understanding the duality that many people fall into, and is she thinking that is J2 (or Granny we call her) talking to her?I really want to give her credit and I really wanted to believe her, but I can't. She didn't give me much to really grab onto as a convincing argument for her so called abilities. And she is not the first animal communicator I have done a little research on. There was one woman mentioned in ""Freeing Keiko"" who said that whales and dolphins were essentially extraterrestrial beings that were guiding the earth through space. Another woman said that Greyhound dogs were also extraterrestrial beings.Just the simple fact that there is glaring inconstancies between different animal communicators should be enough evidence that there really isn't too much, if anything, to Telepathic Animal Communication.It was an entertianing book, I rather enjoyed it. But I am a sceptic. And being a sceptic I would be completely honest about my position. If something really seems to make sense, I will say it does. But this book didn't. And saying that, I would not be talking about this book to my friends or family. If it does turn up in conversation, it will most likely be during our psuedopyschological studies. That is unless someone can show me a real study that is so sound as to prove me wrong. To which, if it did prove me wrong I would say so."

By right-wing fanatics! But that in fact, they are merely stating unpopular views, and are in fact simply being honest.Unfortunately, the truth is that these folks are totally dishonest. And, in some cases, they are unpatriotic as well. On top of that, some of them unequivocally support right-wing Islamic fanaticism. What they frequently appear to want is not academic freedom but the right to engage in academic dishonesty, often in a misguided attempt to hurt a few Jews.We start with a spectacularly dishonest article by Beshara Doumani. He moans that ""pro-Israel lobbying groups"" and others are ""policing what can be said about Israel on campus and in public discourse."" Obviously, anyone who has been on a few major American campuses can see that the anti-Israeli folks have been far more effective at doing just this. He says that Lawrence Summers ""effectively equated criticism of Israel's policies with anti-Semitism."" That's a lie. He then defends the infamous anti-Israeli professors at Columbia University, who in real life substitute racist propaganda for scholarship in the classroom. And he dismisses criticism of this attack on academic standards as the work of right-wing groups, pro-Israeli groups, and donors. Even if some criticism of all this dishonesty were from such groups, that would not invalidate it! He tells us to speak and act before it is too late. I suggest we all do just that, and speak out against him.There are a couple of interesting discussions about the extent to which a professor's ""extracurricular"" work should be protected. My feeling is that it should be. Noam Chomsky is used as an example. I happen to think that Chomsky ought to have a right to tell outright lies as part of his extracurricular activities as long as he does not commit any felonies. Others feel differently about this, and still others feel that even outright academic dishonesty in one's professional work ought to be okay (something I disagree with completely).By the way, speaking of felonies, we do see a reference that Sami al-Arian was ""disciplined for a statement concerning terrorism."" But no mention is made of the enormous amount of evidence that al-Arian had long been a terrorist leader. In fact, that evidence finally got al-Arian fired. Are we now supposed to excuse felons, dismissing their crimes under the mantle of academic freedom? I hope not.Judith Butler repeats the slander that ""any criticism of Israel"" is called anti-Semitic by quite a few folks. And she complains about criticism of the notorious International Solidarity Movement. If she wants to make a case for something, I think she ought to be far more honest. Kathleen Frydl attacks the idea of withholding funding from universities if their expenditures promote ""violence, terrorism, or the destruction of any state."" Now, maybe the wording of such an idea needs some work. But I think it is completely proper to try to stop universities from spending taxpayer money on pro-terrorist propaganda.Amy Newhall is worried about the United States attaching strings to some language programs. But I think she's the problem here. There are programs that the United States government supports to teach, for example, Arabic in universities. The government does so in the hopes that at least a few students in such programs will use their knowledge of the language to work for the government. If the university encourages them not to do so and we wind up without any benefit from those programs, I think there is no reason to continue them: let the universities use their own money to teach Arabic in that case.Perhaps the most vicious article is by Joel Beinin. Beinin seems to attack everyone who opposes the substitution of dishonest propaganda for scholarly work, calling such opposition the work of people he dubs ""the American Likud."" He says ""this is not the first time right-wing fanatics have waged a campaign of vilification, guilt by association, guilt by ethnic or religious affiliation, and delegitimization of dissenting opinions."" And in this regard, he mentions HUAC and Joe McCarthy. But in fact, it is Beinin himself who is doing all this, in the service of right-wing fanatics no less. A special target of Beinin is a particularly praiseworthy organization, Campus Watch. This organization exposes some of the disinformation and incitement we see on campus, but Beinin claims that what it reports is ""false and brazenly bigoted."" It is neither. Once again, Beinin appears to accuse others of what he himself is guilty of.This book pretends to be defending academia. In fact, it is defending academic dishonesty. This dishonesty is a threat to ruin the reputations of plenty of academic departments and possibly discredit entire fields of study. I think we should all encourage the academic community to fight against such violations of academic standards."

However, there are a few cases where the advice is a little outdated given the latest research on the subject.One is the subject of using a mulching mower; research has shown that using a mulching mower does not contribute significantly to thatch buildup. Finely chopped grass clippings from lawn grasses decompose very rapidly. I guess you might get in trouble if you have lots of aggressive weed grasses that grow extremely rapidly, leaving much larger amounts of grass clippings. It is also possible that using a non-mulching mower could get you in trouble; it sounds like Mr. Baker might be using a reel mower, which doesn't pulverize the leaves. The research that I have seen studied the effects of using a mulching mower on lawn grass only, so if you have loads of tall weed grasses, or are using a non-mulching mower, you might have trouble.Another is the subject of aeration. From what I have read, spike aeration (Mr. Baker recommends the use of those spike aerator sandal things) is not very effective. Core aeration, which is admittedly more difficult and expensive, is what gets the best results, and is actually effective at controlling thatch.Here is one of the many pages on these subjects:[...]"

There are books that do and I find the pictures of the weeds very helpful in identifying them. But this book does offer state-by-state help on certain things and resources you can tap to get more information - very helpful.This book is certainly worthy the price I paid for it and I like the tips I picked up. It isn't perfect, but deserves a place on your shelf."

Everyone left lost a family member, and mourning set upon the community.Needless to say, their lot was not easy, and most ultimately succumbed.This is a valuable testament to horrors suffered in the Holocaust by one community, horrors that were repeated in every other ghetto across Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Poland and so on.Heartbreaking.--Alyssa A.

Her basic education took 5 years to complete. Five years later, she still takes many supplementary courses each year to continue her education. Most of her free time is spend with distance learning courses or reaching herbs. Chinese Medicine is vast and deep. A 5 year basic study is not nearly enough time to understand this medicine. In Chinese Medicine, they say even a lifetime is not long enough to understand this medicine. Thankfully for the lay person we have this book!I personally own 2 copies of this book. One I have at home, the other is in our Chinese Medicine office. Many of our patients have purchased their own copy of this book after reading our office copy.The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine is the best book that I have read to understand what my partner practices. I have read other books, likeThe Web That Has No Weaver : Understanding Chinese MedicineandBetween Heaven and Earth: A Guide to Chinese Medicine, although highly recommended, these 2 books are much more technical and can be overwhelming at times (especially The Web 2nd edition). After reading The Complete Illustrated Guide, if you want to learn more then these other two books are worth a read. Far and away the best dietary book on Chinese Medicine is Bob Flaw'sThe Tao of Healthy Eating: Dietary Wisdom According to Traditional Chinese Medicine. Also,The Book of Jook: Chinese Medicinal Porridges--A Healthy Alternative to the Typical Western Breakfastby Bob Flaws is a good helpful for breakfast food and as a total diet longevity practice (similar to Kitchari in Ayurveda).The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine provides a complete overview of all of the modalities included under the largre umbrella of Chinese Medicine. You'll learn about the medicine theory, diagnosis, energetic ""anatomy"", acupuncture, herbal medicine, diet, exercise, qi gong, tai chi, meditation, and lifestyle theory.The section on diet is lacking, in my opinion, however the author does state that information on diet could fill an entire book itself - which is definitely true. ReadThe Tao of Healthy Eating: Dietary Wisdom According to Traditional Chinese Medicinefor proper Chinese Medicine dietary knowledge.The sections on Qi Gong and Tai Chi are great for a general book. You'll be taught a basic sequence in each. For additional learning, Mantak Chia's books and DVDs are some of the most complete spiritual-style Qi Gong practices practices. Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming has created some of the best martial arts style Qi Gong and Tai Chi books and DVDs.The theory and science sections make up the majority of this book, providing an excellent introduction with much knowledge and no fluff. Someone interesting in attending TCM school would greatly benefit by reading this book first. You'll understand what TCM is and have good preparation for the conceptual basis of Chinese Medicine.The entire book is filled with pictures to support the information. A picture is worth 1,000 words and many times it is only through pictures that proper understanding can be attained (like meridians, tongue diagnosis, etc). The book is very well organized with section titles and concise paragraphs with subtitles. It is clear that the authors spent much time and calculation to create this book.Personally, I can't think of anything missing from this book. Although I would have liked to see another 2-4 pages on dietary theory and practice, it is not strong enough of a complaint to remove a star from my rating. This book is 5 stars all the way!Additional note:It is important to remember that Chinese Medicine is a medicine and should only be practiced by a trained professional. There is a lot that a person can do to improve health and grow spiritually without the help of a Chinese Medicine practitioner/doctor - like diet, exercise, meditation, qi gong, yoga, etc. However when it comes to deeper knowledge and practices like Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine, these are best left to the professionals. My partner is a professional Chinese Medicine Acupuncturist and Herbalist. It is common that people come into her office who are worse off after having self-treated using herbal knowledge from books, magazines, and newscasts. Taking herbs for symptom relief is not anywhere close to the Chinese Medicine herbal understanding. If you are suffering from health problems, please see a professional.After it's complete, an education in Chinese Medicine is a 5 year Ph.D. program (including both Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine). This is an entire year longer than Western Medicine. This is not to say that Chinese Medicine is superior, but rather that both studies are long and difficult. Chinese Medicine should not be looked at to be inferior to modern Western medicine. Rather both are complete forms of medicine and require much more understanding than can be gained by a single text book.The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine is the best place to start to better understand what Chinese Medicine is and how you can live a healthier and happier life.Was my review helpful?

Cox's argument was that urbanization and secularization go together, and that they empty the world of mythic and traditional religious power.Today forty years after the publication of his book the world is in the midst of a global struggle in which the forces of Western democratic society are pitted against a radical Islamic revivalist fundamentalism. Moreover within the realms of other religions including Christianity there has been a kind of 'return to religion' which was certainly not dreamnt of in Cox analysis. He did not have a clue in regard to the Evangelical revival in the United States, and the prominent place it would come to play, ( Perhaps unprecedented place) in American politics.This does not make Cox's analysis wrong for his time. Nor was he mistaken in seeing the important trend to secularization. He only made the mistake most of us make of seeing the past and future of what seemed to him the predominant and irreversible trend of his time.But History and the development of Mankind have a way of surprising us all.As a footnote I would say that the one area of the world in which Cox analysis does seem to be largely correct today is Europe. 'Post-Christian Europe' however does not seem the apogee of human enlightentment , the wave of the future. Rather it seems more a declining island already invaded by those kind of 'religious forces it expelled as Christian and is receiving as Muslim'.Irony of ironies, that the very heart of the 'secular city' today seems as if it will in a matter of generations take a great fall into backwardness. But again this is an aside, and I would instead make the more general caveat, that no one should fall so readily into the underlying assumption of Cox's analysis i.e. that there is a predominant historical trend for the future which we can clearly discern.Wisdom and humility would suggest that we rely more on our powers of future observation than of extrapolation from the Past."

Davis ""The Rose Bride""",0/2,1.0,1177718400,Disappointing to say the least,"This book is probably, in my opinion, one of (if not THE) worst in the Night World Series. It is Ash's story this time, who's soulmate just happens to be a human. (which Ironically was shadowed upon in the first book, 'Secret Vampire'.) Ash's character was cool, charismatic....and totally wasted in this book. Mary Lynnette was too self riteous, too...I don't know. To me, she didn't come off as the strong female lead she was supposed to. Instead, I found myself annoyed at her several times throughout the book. She was presumptuous, she was always assuming things, and she was rather stereotypic if you ask me. I think someone like Maggy from 'Black Dawn', or even someone like Hanna or Gillian from 'Soulmate' and 'Dark Angel' would have been a better match for Ash, not this smart alec, holier than thou woman named Mary Lynnette.The book itself was lacking as well. We pretty much learn nothing about the nightworld, it doesn't much progress the series except to mention a few characters that appear in future books. All in all, a disappointment. Ash's first appearance in 'Secret Vampire' stole the show, so when this book was released, I was ecstatic. 'Finally', I thought. 'Something that touches on Ash's past and personality. We will finally get to read his story.' Well, as it turned out, he was poorly underwritten. Or perhaps this particular book would have worked better if it had been a little later in the series, if Mary Lynnette wasn't so sharp tongued, if there weren't so many CHARACTERS to concentrate on. This wasn't so much Ash and M.L's story as it was all the sisters. Too many people to concentrate on. The three sisters should have been given their own book for character developement if that was the case. I would suggest this book only to those who wish to further their Night World series collection, or just their L.J Smith collection, in general. As for the enjoyment factor?...Nadda."

401,0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,0/0,5.0,884476800,Great!!!!,"This is my favorite out of all the Night World books I love how Mary-Lynnette and Ash didn't get along at first i thought it was funny and cute. I recommend this bok to anyone It is really a must reader. Ciao All, Sky"
402,0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,0/0,5.0,884476800,The Best of the Night World,"Though the plot is much like that of Pride and Prejudice, this book has a real feeling and flow that the rest of the Night World books can't compare with. There is a depth of character in both Mary-Lynnette, Ash, his sisters and Mark that L.J. Smith can usually only spin in the three books of her earlier trilogies. The departure of Ash at the end of the book has left me, now more than a year later, still anticipating his return, and the furthering of the relationship between him and Mary-Lynnette. The characters seemed more down-to-earth and more easy to identify with, as the author didn't go into the somewhat fascinating but still pointless and shallow descriptions of every physical characteristic of the characters. Mary-Lynnette seemed a truly real girl, with dreams of her career in astronomy and her share of problems. Ash, although made a spectacle of with his good looks in the first novel of the Night World, was intelligent and portrayed well. I wish that Ms. Smith had chosen to chronicle this book into an entire trilogy as she has in the past; I would have found Mary-Lynnette and Ash even more enthralling if we had seen their development over the course of a longer period."
403,0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,0/0,5.0,884390400,This is the all time best book!,"This is the all time best book. She mentoins in the book how anyone can be a vampire, who knows. Well anyway I like the idea of having one soulmate and one crazed werewolf crush. P.S I think that it is a good twist on the story about how anone can be part of the night world."
404,0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,0/0,5.0,880502400,It was good!!,I trust every girl is now inlove with Ash?? We ll I sure am cause he is gorgeous and his eyes......????? Heaven. Ok now this book was well written I like that it included love springing between other characters(Mark and Jade) The part I LOVED was when Ash was leaving and was saying he wanted to become human and everything that was so...romantic.he wanted to become something he has always hated in order to be with her......(email for chats)Who has irc?? Cause we have to make a channel for all us soulmate wanters!!!
405,0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,1/1,5.0,875404800,This book is one of my favorates.,"I have read just about everything L.J. Smith has ever written. It all started when a friend of mine gave me The Strange Power- Vol. 1 of my favorate L.J. trilogy entitled Dark Visions and I loved it! I read everything I could get my hands on by her!! Before I discovered these books I never read anything due to sheer boredom. Now I feel that these books have helped me immensly! Anyway, I really should get on to my comments concerning the book. Daughters Of Darkness is really one of the best Night World books of all. It is sweet, suspenseful, and well written all in one great package. Unfortunetly, though these book literally melt my heart, I am afriad I will never find a man worthy of my all time favorate L.J. Smith badboys such as Ash(Daughters of Darkness), Gabriel(mmm.. oh! um Dark Visions), Nick(Secret Circle), and Quinn(short but sweet... from The Chosen). Oh well!! Anyhow read the books, people!! Then you'll know what I'm talking about!! OK!!???"
406,0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,1/1,5.0,874368000,My favorite of all her books!!!!!!!,"This is the best book L.J. has written, and I've read all seven (they're all good). I'm still waiting for Black Dawn to come out. Mary-Lynnette and Ash are so realistic, besides that he's a vampire. My favorite part is when Mare keeps kicking him in the shins. It's funny, because it also tells us (this is what I interpreted) that it doesn't matter what race you are, it matters whats on the inside. Afterall, like Jade says, &quot;You can't be soulmates with vermin!&quot"
407,0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,3/4,5.0,1047600000,Second Book in the Night World Series,"Set in Briar Creek, Oregon, ""Daughters of Darkness"" primarily follows 17-year-old Mary-Lynnette Carter, though the book is supposedly about her new neighbors, three vampire sisters: Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade Redfern. The book does start off that way, following these three runaways on their way to their aunt's house. There they discover that their aunt has been killed--staked through the heart by a possible vampire hunter who wants to punish them for breaking the laws of the Night World, which all vampires, werewolves, and witches must abide by in this series. In an attempt to cover their tracks, the sisters bury the old woman in their backyard, but Mary-Lynnette sees them doing this--and again, later on, in the company of her younger brother, Mark, when they transfer the body into the woods.To make a long story short, Mary-Lynnette and Mark are befriended by these vampires in a blood-tie ceremony and promise to help find the killer running loose in Briar Creek. Like all of L. J. Smith's books, there's an added bit of romance to the paranormal/horror base of the story, for both Mary-Lynnette and Mark. (They meet their respective soulmates: Ash and Jade.) Even though I haven't read any of the other books in this series and can't compare this one to the others, I really liked ""Daughters of Darkness."" It was fast-paced, well-written, and ideal for teens who are into paranormal romances."
408,0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,7/10,5.0,943401600,This book had me giggling,"I'm sorry, but I just find the way Mary Lennette treats Ash to be just hillarious. Mary Lennette is like a Nancy Drew. Ok, actually I never liked the Nancy Drew series and never read them, but the book kind of starts out with a mystery like that. She's just a character who if Iknew her in person, I'd probably like her. She's smart, and stands pretty much up for what she believes in and really does care for people. She's just totally not the person I could ever picture Ash with. I still can giggle at that part where she realizes he can see more in the dark and without thinking just shines the flashlight into his eyes. She discovers horribly diliated pupils, and Ash is just screaming out in pain. Then, right after that she asks him to tell her how many stars he can see, and he's just like &quot;None. I'm blind!&quot; I don't know, maybe the way I said it isn't that funny, but I thought it was hillarious. Ash is hillarious with his little side comments and he's simply a very interesting character. It took me awhile to get myself to finally buy it, but its definetly a good read."
409,0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,A107F528SN3XJU,"""islandmunky""",2/3,5.0,1039651200,Another awesome book from LJ Smith!,"Daughters of Darkness, the second book in LJ Smith's Night World series, is probably the best book in the series.Mary-Lynette is the intellectual heroine in this book. She's a human obsessed with astromomy who's stumbled across a strange, supernatural secret about the new girls next door. Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade are beautiful vampire sisters who have escaped from their strict home across the country. Mary Lynette and her brother, Mark, become quick friends with the sisters, but someone doesn't want them to live in harmony.And then there's the slight problem that the girls' brother, Ash (who appeared in the first Night World book, Secret Vampire), who has come to bring his sisters back. Ash is icy cold and ruthless, but Mary Lynette might just be the person to melt his heart.This book is so awesome that you won't want to put it down until you've finished. But I would definitely recommend reading the Night World series in order, since the characters reappear and the events link together, so if you haven't read Secret Vampire yet, do that first. But if you have, definitely read this book!"
410,0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,2/3,5.0,905644800,THIS IS MY FAV BOOK IN THE SERIES!!!!,"This is the best book out of the Night World series. At first, in the first book, u think Ash is the bad guy, but that opinion totally goes out the window when u read this book.(The same thing w/ Quinn, but that's another book) I have all the Night World books and love them all. I've read them all over and over, but this is my fav. I can totally relate w/ the feeling of longing Mary-Lynette felt at the beginning, and like her, I am looking for someone to share the night w/ (even though i know only a little about astronomy) Ash is definantly a character. He's strong-willed, and has a smart mouth, but is vulnerable like a hurt child underneath it all. There needs to be another book that continues the story of Ash, Mary-Lynette, Mark and the sisters. Ash had small parts in Dark Angel (when he got Gillian out of that club Angel lured her in) and in Soulmates (when he was in Circle Daybreak when he met Hannah and told her about his soulmate.) If you haven't read this one yet, it is a must read. I beleive in soulmates and it makes me wish for mine even more If only the Night World really existed . . . but oh well. I hope you bring in Mary-Lynette and Ash again, I would really like to know the outcome."
411,0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,AXYESYR1GNGM0,DavisJes,0/0,5.0,1347926400,Mary Ash,Can't believe I have never reviewed this book before. First read this back when I was 13. Like a lot of girls wanting the mysterious boyfriend and believed in soul-mates which drug me into these books. Rereading it over time years later still stands the test of time for me. Ash is that bad boy you want and your parents want you to stay away from even though he seems like a jerk there is just something about him that make you wanna root for him.
412,0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,A3CLKX8W3F1L1D,Werther Bentine Torres,0/0,3.0,1276560000,Quick and Fun,"As an adult reader I gave this a 3 star because some things were not very logical. The story was well written and as a teen I think I would have given it a 4 maybe even a 5. I would not mind letting my children read this book as the love relationships are based on emotions rather than physical appearance and pleasure. The relationship between the characters are healthy, for example they do not have the male stalking the female or the female saying she is going to die without the male. Yes that is a comparison to the Twilight series, but this series was written long before Twilight was thought of.The parts I did not find logical is the fact the vampire girls were not going to use any of the powers in the new town they moved too. Why not? I get that they did not want to kill their food (people) but why not talk to each other telepathically. What is the point of not doing that? No one would have known they were doing that. Vampires are stronger than people and one girl had a hard time doing a task a human could do without a problem. Another thing that bothered me about this book is Poppy and James are not in this book. There was a thought of them for a second but I would have liked something to let me know how they were doing. Is Poppy still an illegal vampire? Did her dad except them and her living dead situation? I mean so many unanswered questions."
413,0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,A2KBHSK5BS35BH,Leeanna Chetsko,0/0,1.0,1260662400,Night World 2: Daughters of Darkness,"Night World #2: Daughters of Darkness, by L. J. SmithFor me, ""Daughters of Darkness"" is the one sour note in Smith's Night World series. It was the one book in the nine book series that I had to force myself to finish (I am obsessive about finishing everything I read).The concept is interesting, but I feel it could have used better execution. As with all Night World books, the protagonist is female. Mary-Lynette is a human and unaware of the secret world of vampires, werewolves, and other spooky things that exist around her. She thinks she lives in the quietest, most boring town in the world, but that's all about to change when a series of startling events happens.When the next door neighbor goes missing just as her three nieces arrive in town, and Mary-Lynette sees them burying something in the backyard, she's immediately suspicious. Unable to leave the mystery alone, she heads next door and meets the new arrivals, who further her apprehension about the disappearance of her neighbor. The girls remind her of predators, which is unsurprising as the girls are lamia, or born vampires.The mystery of who killed the neighbor takes up a good chunk of the book, and in my opinion, is very over used. It just drags on too long, and every time there was a new twist in the whodunit, I kept thinking, ""Okay, that's the end of it now...no, wait...there's more. Sigh.""Ash Redfern also makes an appearance in this book (some readers may remember him from ""Night World #1: Secret Vampire,"" where he waylaid Poppy), and is a starring character along with his sisters. Initially he's on the hunt for the three sisters, who ran away from a vampire enclave. Ash is characterized as the ultimate vampire - humans are vermin and nothing more, to him. Mary-Lynette takes an immediate dislike to him when meeting him for the first time. And here's where the potentially interesting concept comes in - Ash and Mary-Lynette are soulmates, but unlike Smith's other couples, the two can't stand each other.But something about this book just didn't do it for me. Maybe it was the overly drawn out murder mystery. Or maybe it was that the main character, Mary-Lynette, seemed dry. Or maybe even what seemed interesting - soulmates disliking each other - somehow doesn't fit in a series that's about finding your soulmate.1/5."

I thought it was really different how Mary-Lynette and Ash tried to ignore the fact that they were soulmates, and it made the story much more interesting to read. Personally, I never would have guessed that it was Jeremy who had killed the girls aunt 'cause he seemed like a relly nice guy, but I guess you should never judge a book by its cover. I really wish that there was a sequel to this book 'cause I really want to find out what happens with Ash and Mary-Lynette. This is definately the best Night World book - although they are all excellent. ~Mary"
418,0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,0/0,5.0,898128000,Wow! L.J. Smith is definitely my new favorite author!,"I loved this book so much! I couldn't put it down for a minute. I've read almost all of the Nightworld series, but this by far is the best. The humor and the romance that brings Ash and Mary-Lynette together is great. The ending was kind of sad though. I would definitely read any sequels to this book. I hope that there is one. For those people who think the soulmate principle is getting old, I disagree. The author should keep the theory, but add a few new twists or plots to provide conflict and interest."

I liked the rivalry between Ash and Jeremy, but don't think it should really be that severe. How could the two races get along, even if the vamps were more powerful, or the wolves are stupid? I have to admit the only corny part is the fact that the two pairs of soulmates are related. I just really liked this book, and think it is the best yet. I do want to see what happens to all of them later on, like say at the begining of the the battle to save the world. I just want to come back to see that Mary-Linnette and Mark are vamps, etc."

I like the way she mixes both of them together without going overboard. She is my favorite author but I really wish that she could make her books come out monthly.And I wish that she could include other stories besides the soulmate principal. Like maybe a vampire killer as the main character.A totally wicked character that loves to kill. Maybe she could bring us what she feels goes through a killer's mind. There's a lot of other ways she could make us love her books,maybe if she described the NIGHT WORLD more. Maybe stopping and making the females a lot stronger instead of pitiful weaklings. Maybe they should be open-minded about becoming a vampire.Anyways, she's my favorite author and I love her books."

Smith1996I continue to be surprised by how overally well-written the ""Night World"" books are, collectively. For young people in particular, they are quality fiction.Three young female vampires come to tiny Briar Creek, Oregon, to live with their also-vampire elderly aunt, but homicide is the word of the day, and curious neighbors Mark and Mary-Lynette quickly find themselves ensconced in the dangerous waters of the Night World -- and the even more unpredictable currents of love.I didn't quite like ""Daughters"" as much as ""Secret Vampire"", the first book in the series. The tale had a bit less... urgency... than its predecessor, and while I did like the redemption of Ash, bad-boy blonde from the first novel, the character development was again a little underexplored. But the world-building is pleasant and well-done, without info-dumping on young readers with potentially short attention spans.Again I can't help but wonder what a greater length could have done for the series -- ""Daughters' ""plot is a bit simplistic. The ending felt... unsatisfying.But without doubt worth a read, as I will wager the entire series will be.6.8/10"

Tired of living in a society that acts as though it's stuck in the 16th century, they decided to go live with their great-aunt. Unfortunately, she's been staked, and they have no idea who did it. Things are further complicated when Ash, their brother, comes to take them back. Ash gets something of a shock, however - he finds his soulmate in the small town of Briar Creek, and she's human.If you've read the first Night world book, you'll remember Ash. Believe it or not, he gets even better in this book. It's hilarious watching the usually confident Ash try to figure out how to deal with the reality of having a human soulmate (one who kicks him at every opportunity). This book is different from all the other Night World books, in that the soulmates here do not like each other and would like to find a way not to have that bond. I consider Ash to be one of the more complex characters in the series, and this book peels away a lot of the layers. Mary-Lynnette, his soulmate, is great, because she doesn't just let Ash walk all over her - she talks back, and, like I said, she kicks him a lot. The mystery element of the book is pretty interesting, and I liked the three sisters, although the author doesn't really go into as much depth with their characters as you might think she does from what the back of the book says. This book is less about the sisters and more about the murder, Ash, and Mary-Lynnette."

Mary-Lynette and the rest of the characters are well thought-out also, and I hope to read about them in the future. This is my favorite series of L.J.

I look forward to reading Huntress and Black Dawn, since I've read all the other Night World books numerous times already, to indulge my fantasy craving mind. My only disappointment is that there are no shapeshifter soulmates. They must be just as intriguing as witches and vampires. And why can't I find Volume one of the Vampire Diaries anywhere?

Smith fans swooning in the aisles.It is an interesting premise, and things start to heat up when the girls arrive at their great-aunt Opal Burdock's house in Briar Creek only to find her staked through the heart. Panicking, they bury the body in the garden outside, but are witnessed by Mary-Lynette who's watching the stars on the hill overlooking the house. Doubtful that Mrs Burdock is really dead, Mary-Lynette and her brother nevertheless investigate, and come across the vampire sisters hunting in the wood...However, because Mark and Jade fall pretty fast for each other a truce is made and the sisters share their fears with the two siblings - something is out there, something that's killing things, and all of them work their dectective skills to figure out who it is ... Ash? Bunny Marten, the shop attendant with the lamia name? Jeremy, the garage worker with a deep, dark secret? A vampire hunter?And then Ash turns up, and to his and Mary-Lynette's horror, they find they are soulmates, destined to be together even though Ash is not a very nice guy.The story is pretty interesting, and it's fun to guess whodunnit, though I admit I was a *little* disappointed as to the murderer's motives. L.J. Smith obviously had fun designing the three sisters, all with different personalities and features. For once there wasn't a contrived happy ending that is so popular in L.J. Smith's books, and the atmosphere of the book was very well done too - the desert-like Briar Creek gave a sense of being trapped in the middle of nowhere with a wild beast on the loose, and chemistry between all the characters was realistic, poignent, and sometimes funny. (Watch out for Ash giving Jeremy a hard time).All in all, this was a much better book than the first 'Secret Vampire', which extented the Night World a bit, and mingled together characters that have been in previous books (Ash) and characters who'll appear in future ones (Quinn)."

In the first book you would have never thought it would happen, but I was glad to see the character development.What I like about the Night World books is that while you could read each book separately as a stand-alone, it's great to see prior plot lines and character weaved into the current story. It makes you feel even more connected to the story and the world.These books are short reads, but I find them pretty satisfying because the plot moves along and it focuses on what you really want to see."

She likes her quiet life, stargazes as a hobby, bases her life around becoming an astronomer, and hopes the three new girls moving in next door with the kindly, if eccentric, Mrs. Burdock will help to bring her shy brother, Mark, out of his shell.Unfortunately, what she ends up with is a murder mystery, romance she doesn't want, and oh, yeah, those three new girls are vampires with a dangerous older brother coming to drag them back home.There are a LOT of characters to focus on, as per usual with a murder mystery. We have Mary-Lynnette, Mark, the three sisters Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade, their brother Ash, and the local werewolf, Jeremy. And those aren't even the suspects. The endless supply of characters in such a short amount of pages is a little overwhelming, with so many aspects of so many characters not fully explored. But what really gets the reader, even the fans of over ten years, is the star-crossed attraction between Mary-Lynnette and Ash.It's a bumpy road, to put it lightly. Mary-Lynnette is a simple, if nosy, human girl, while Ash is a dangerous, well-known vampire--and not well-known in the good sense, in Mary-Lynnette's book. Understandable; in Secret Vampire and Daughters of Darkness it's implied he's killed human girls and worse. There are very subtle hints at sexual abuse toward human females that younger readers may miss, but the words are enough to paint a picture that Ash is Very Bad.Many fans complain at the ending, but it is the ending that keeps them so captivated with these two. Mary-Lynnette wants to finish high school. She can't see herself with Ash as he is now, knowing his past. Ash is sorry and wants to repent, by the end of the novel, but wanting isn't enough. Mary-Lynnette is dealing with a soulmate who is potentially mentally unstable, definitely cruel, and by all human means, a classified felon (if he could be traced, that is).L.J. Smith did well in ending the story with no conclusion (which she has promised the fans would come at the end of the series for years; ten years later and still nothing). Ash needs room to grow in order to be someone Mary-Lynnette will not regret willingly falling in love with.This is a good book, by no means the best, but excellent for the series. It was the second book I read (no, Secret Vampire was not the first) and ultimately the one that got me hooked.Here's to hoping the Mary-Lynnette/Ash fans get closure in the near future.

Three beautiful sisters hide a deadly secret that threatens to be discovered by the inhabitants of a sleepy town. Rowan, Kestrel and Jade are on the run - from their families and from the Elders. They know that their brother Ash (James' cousin from Secret Vampire) is seeking them and that he is bent on returning them to the boring life they have led.Two siblings chance upon their secret and find themselves befriending vampires. As they learn more about the Night World, their own lives are turned upside down by a sickening deed. Who or what is it that stalks Briar Creek?Fantastic! I enjoyed this book immensely with its portrayal of two very different and yet similar families. The obvious difference is the species but the vampire girls have never had true freedom before while Mary-Lynette and Mark have lived their lives in a small town in the country. The similarities lie in the older sisters. Both fiercely protective of their siblings, they will do anything to keep them from harm.I loved the conflict between Ash and M'Lin, especially when they first meet. The story progressed well and unlike some stories, had a more convincing ending, rather than the sudden death of the baddie.

Smith's books are fantastic; she's my absolute favorite writer. Her writing style is very natural and realistic and her characters are so real, you start looking for them in real life. I fell in love with Ash, especially in how, even though he's a fierce vampire, he's completely helpless when it comes to Mary Lynette. Smith writes the most wonderful characters. I never liked fantasy or romance novels, but her books are a notable exception. My friends think I'm crazy because I'm in college and I'm still reading YA books, but, I'm telling you, her books are ageless!!! If you haven't read this, you're definitely missing out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
486,0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,1/1,5.0,904694400,A love story for haters of love and romance,"Thought you would never ever fall in love? So did the hero (if you can call him that) of this story. Ash doesn't particularly like the idea of having to chase his little sisters across the country after they ran away from home. And when he finds them he doesn't exactly love the idea that they have also told humans about the Night World, a secret society of the supernatural. Or the idea that his youngest sister is in love with a human. But what's worse is Ash's soulmate is a smart, beautiful human from a hick town who hates him and everything he stands for. Also, what's worse, his great-aunt is killed with a stake meaning that somebody knew she was a vampire. All this adds up to the worst thing that can happen to a teenage boy who wants to prove that he hates humans, loves fast cars and even faster girls. This is the funniest, most ludicrous book you could ever expect to read from L.J.Smith. The characters are SOO familiar, you might expect to see them in school the next day. A must read for readers of all ages and COMEDY CENTRAL lovers."

I didn't ask for this, and if somebody had said last week that I'd be in...involved... with a human, I'd have knocked his head off. I mean, after howels of derisive laughter. But.&quot; I doidn't catch what he was origenally goning to say... I'd be in LOVE, but he paused and changed the word love to involved. so while she sat there hating him, he loved her!! How blind can a girl get!! theres a fine guy there trippin over her, and she kickes him in the shin!!! twice!oh well. what I really want it a sequel though. I am just dien wonderin what happens. the lasy part where he said goodbye was soo good. If L J ever stops writing I am going to be sooooooo sad. but in conclusion, this was one of her best books.

I admit, it's nice to have little soulmates wandering the world blissfully, but I was really glad that in this book, it wasn't the case. But despite that nice turn of events, it does not change the fact that, well, this book tends to asume everyone likes happy endings full of love. Those endings are great, but I felt this one could have used a twist, or unusual ending. Instead of the evil vampire being reformed and changed, maybe he should leave in a rage or something like that However, I still hope you'll read it, after all, it is entertainment."

My disappointment is not so much with the quality of the puzzles within it but with the quality of the publishing. The paper is poor quality; it won't hold up under much erasing if you use pencil, and if you use gel pens, the ink bleeds through to the other side. The squares to color in are too large, making the finished image very pixillated and hard to make out. Also, the guide numbers are located at the right and bottom edges of the puzzle, instead of left and top, making it more difficult for a right-handed person to see while solving.Save your money, and buy the Games Magazine publication instead."

All the Non Ishida Sunday Telegraph books are printed in mass-market paperback form on cheap pulp paper (which easily rips if you use mechanical pencils like I do). The book is also very small (only 7 inches tall and 4 1/2 inches wide) and is bound like a regular paperback, so it's hard to keep open while you're trying to complete the puzzles. The other major problem with this series is that many of the puzzles are large, so that in order to fit them in the book, the publishers have broken up the grid to fit half on one page and half on the other! I get so frustrated, I want to cut the puzzles out the book and tape them to another sheet of paper before I do them.I'd suggest Mind-Sharpening Pixel Puzzles and Perplexing Pixel Puzzles, both by Peter Gordon, or Games Magazine Presents Paint by Numbers instead of these books, because of their large format and quality paper."

Filled with lots of different art puzzles with the simplest of clues (a series of numbers), the final result never ceases to astonish.The one nit-pick I have is that the book is small, meaning the puzzles don't get that big either. As the puzzle has grown in popularity, so has the size of the puzzle, creating a more challenging atmosphere. These puzzles, by comparison, feel more like a beginner's version. But they're still fun and the results are, as usual, cool."

In eight highly readable chapters he presents clear discussions of several areas of Colonial America, among them: the explosion in population, the diverse ethnicity, the world of white indentured servents, black slavery and its trade, along with a discussion of the predominant middle class life many enjoyed, and finishes with three fine chapters on Colonial religion and the Great Awakening. His mastery of his subject matter and the clarity of his writing is a joy. The Scotch-Irish, the German religious sects who were excellent farmers, the terrified blacks kidnapped and marched 550 miles to the coast and into slavery, the desperate white indentured servents selling themselves into virtual slavery for a time, the always extremely dangerous ocean crossings, the greedy-yet terrified slaveholders and the cruel slave codes they wrote, the relatively prosperous Americans, the coming of G! ! eorge Whitefield--America's most spectacular preacher, the religious schisms that the Great Awakening brought: all these stories are here. And all packed into a highly readable book. A pleasure to read. Thank you Professor Hofstadter."

Here we see the slave trade not just from a one-sided arcadia, but from every side, from the profiteers and the oppressed, from the African kings selling their nation to the early-day abolitionists mildly arguing their case. We see the white slaves too, the pains and humiliations of indentured servitude to the hearts and minds of men believing themselves at the very least a step up from inhumanity.Then there is the middle class of the pre-revolutionary colonies, filled with religious fanatics and patriotic zealots, all of them looking to make a buck. We see that this class formed the basic foundations of the nation to come and how the politicians of the day catered mostly to this hardly regal, far-reaching group of normal, everyday folks. This chapter, perhaps, gives the fullest picture of the society that was that went on to create the society we are today.And then there is a long discussion of the church and the 'Great Awakening' that plundered through the minds of so many post-witch hunting citizens. These chapters explain the foundations that led not just to a seperation of church and state, but to the required need for religious diversity and how this principle, above all else, came to found our subsequent ideas on American freedom.A glorious, neccessary book, it makes one mourn for this already celebrated historian and wonder what might have been (and regardless of that annoying cliche, one can't help but think in such basic praise dialect when finishing)."

Grateful,4/4,5.0,1207094400,mirroring the reader,"I find it fascinating that this wonderful glimpse into our nation shortly before the American Revolution could be thought of as stuffy, boring and a waste of time. Hofstader, a brilliant and yet very human scholar, has offered us a wonderfully concise, compelling and illuminating read - a rare and precious gift to anyone wishing to examine the evolution of our nation. He has done all the work, not only allowing us to form our own conclusions from the facts rather than spoon-feeding us his unsubstantiated opinion, but has presented this vast amount of data in a breezy, very readable manner. The only explanation I could arrive at of how anyone could find this great book a waste of time is that these reviews are as much a reflection of the reviewer as the book under review.Bravo Professor Hofstader. I regret that you did not live to complete your masterpiece."

Most of his previous work was analytic social history, more like sociology than what the popular mind may consider as history. Although that work was excellent and he proved himself an accomplished essayist, with this one he proves he has an excellent touch with narrative history. He can still singe right through to the heart of what makes the period studied a period that, whatever our superficial technological guises, we still live in.We have moved past slavery, which was so entrenched in American social structure in 1750. But the persistence with which Americans pursued slavery, as if they perceived it was the only way to build a nation and a new kind of nation, one built purely on self-interest, brings the reader to realize that the nation we live in now remains built on slavery. The vast semi-middle classes and lower classes remain slaves to their debased tastes, their lives must remain empty and out of their will's control so that their master's, the tiny set of property and power holders, may prosper and keep building, all for their own prospering only. At the same time, the masters tell these slaves it is all done for the glory of--back then it was ""God,"" now it is sometimes ""God"" and sometimes everyday mammon.Hofstadter also lets us see the centrality of religion in everyday American life at the same, another factor which has altered only superficially. If America continues to punish the flesh and look to some vague point in the future when God will make everything right, the precedence was there at 1750. If now we seem to live for today, it is not in terms of fully enriching ourselves within the potentials of this world below, but only in terms of momentary indulgences to keep us preoccupied until some dim future when all will be resolved and explained. Candy and candy music are the so-called indulgences, much as prayers and verse-reading were the momentary indulgences to keep the body bearing through this world until the next appeared.Always, Hosftadter reveals, without preaching. The reader can draw the conclusions, even if Hofstadter's brilliant supply of facts leads the careful reader to see the connections between yesterday and today. Considering this book came out four decades ago, it teaches a hard lesson, that the more America thinks it progresses, the more it becomes its same old self."

Knopf.This is a good time to read (or re-read) the histories of Richard Hofstadter, who explained the background of McCarthyism. McCarthyism is back, big time. The foreground is different. The background is the same.Hofstadter's writing career, 1944-1970, was almost exactly congruent with the first McCarthyism, and his gracefully written books were bestsellers among lovers of American liberty.The titles of the best-known reveal his thrust: ""Anti-intellectualism in American Life"": ""The Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays""; ""Social Darwinism in American Thought""; ""The Development of Academic Freedom in the United States.""When he passed the age of 50, Hofstadter projected a massive social history of America, which would require 18 years to write. He died after completing only eight chapters of a scene-setting volume, which were published as ""America at 1750"" in 1971.So this little volume is a good place to start before returning to his earlier volumes. It was Hofstadter's opinion that by 1750, peculiarly American attitudes, customs, institutions and morals had formed after six or seven generations away from Europe, and that these were so powerful they still controlled much that we did two centuries later.He was certainly a believer in American exceptionalism, but unlike the antidemocratic, antiliberal ranters about American exceptionalism today, he did not think that everything America did and stood for was wise or benevolent; nor that anyone who dared to criticize our failings was a less than 100 percent American.The chapter headings reveal that. After an opening review of demographics, his first three substantive chapters are on forced labor, white and black; and the capitalist slave trade.Only after reminding us that America was a deeply flawed place does he begin writing about its attractive aspects in ""The Middle Class World.""One aspect of American exceptionalism is that it was history's first majority middle class community.Hofstadter died too soon to remonstrate against the destruction of the middle class in favor of finance capitalism, but he was aware of the threat.His final three chapters are about religion, particularly the Great Awakening in the 1740s.Until then, Americans were unchurched, in the main, although there were established churches in many colonies that taxed everybody.But believers and unbelievers who disdained to pay for someone else's church were free to move, and did.Americans evolved a wholly secular idea of government, not because they were irreligious (which they weren't even if unchurched) but because no sect (after the early days in New England) could command the adherence of a large enough majority to persecute the rest. Thus, the idea of toleration, which was, for most, limited to toleration of Protestants.But it was a good start."

I'm new to Chicago, and I want to find the places to go off the beaten path.I wish I had skimmed the book before I bought it. In this book, the author reviews places he feels one needs to see. Review after review of restaurants and clubs and stores, the author used descriptions like, ""decent"" and ""nondescript."" In one review, he claims he is ""a tad ambivalent"" about that specific restaurant, and in another, he reviews a bar as being the sort that ""you never want to go to but find yourself in anyway."" Even the places he talked about positively, he never got excited about them. The most you'll get is a restaurant that serves food that is ""quite good."" He spends a good chunk of the book talking about how he is an ""old man"" now, and talks about things he did when he was young and what the neighborhoods of Chicago were like years ago, and in many of his reviews he admits that he hasn't been to that place in some time. This is fine if that's what you are looking for, but I would recommend a book on Chicago history if that's the case. The last straw was a review of a resale shop that ACTUALLY starts out with, ""Nothing special."" Why include this in your book of places ""you want to know about"" if it is nothing special? I stopped reading the book after that listing, and it went straight in the trash. Worthless."

The images are taunting and very nicely rendered, however, there are some strong hidden meanings within them.

I want to know why that symbolizes in the story, what is the author trying to describe or proof to the reader?I think this is a book quite dangerous for parents to read for their kids at bedtime, unless you go further in describing them the history and cross-meanings of the book--perhaps that is complete package of the book, and what the author want every parent or teacher to do."

Pullen, in his seminal work ""The Twentieth Maine"" describes Ellis Spear as a determined man with a dry sense of humor, the kind to ""take the convervative view of men and events."" Ellis Spear, a schoolteacher prior to the war, joined the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment as a lieutenant in 1862. He would over the course of the Civil War rise to the commissioned rank of Colonel and the brevet rank of Brigadier General, a remarkable performance for a man with no prior military training. His duties with the 20th Maine would take him everywhere the Union Army of the Potomac traveled from late 1862 through Appomattox in 1865. As a Major, Spear was often the day-to-day commander of the 20th after August 1863.The 20th Maine is rather more famous than most volunteer regiments, thanks to its heroic fight on Little Round Top on the second day of the Battle of Gettyburg, a stand dramatized by Jeff Shaara in the novel ""Killer Angels"" and in the movie ""Gettysburg."" Spear's recollection of that day varies in the details from the traditional account presented by Pullen but this probably says more about how confusing a battle can be, especially when recollected thirty or forty years later, than about any real contradition in facts.""Recollections"" actually has three parts: Spear's notes jotted down during the war itself; a first attempt at writing them up in narrative form around 1896, and a more finished attempt undertaken sometime after 1900. The post-1900 attempt is the most readable, and is presented first. It should be read in close conjunction with the end notes to understand the context in which Spear was writing. A comparison with the other versions provides an interesting lesson in historiography.Spear's recollections document the life of the regiment in camp and on campaign. He details the challenges posed by the weather, the terrain, the poor food, the often indifferent leadership, and the Confederates themselves. Spear writes in a matter-of-fact manner, interspersed with the kind of understated dry humor well-known to those who have lived in Down East Maine. His story is a remarkable tribute to the toughness of Civil War volunteers, who soldiered under sometimes appallingly bad conditions with grumpy good humor and perseverence. Spear comes across in this narrative as a dedicated, common sense officer who conscientiously carries out his duties. Spear's gift for observation captures, among other events, some excellent vignettes of the temporary truces established by opposing picket lines, the sometimes strange persistence of good manners in the midst of war, and the inherent brutality of combat.This book is highly recommended to students of the Civil War and to casual readers looking for a sense of the times."

So her handsome but shallow Italian admirer convinces his best friend, a shy and slightly morose chef, to dazzle the woman with some exquisite cooking, for which the callow one takes credit.This the shy chef does, with remarkable results, since he also falls in love with the American woman (gazing from afar), and his suddenly-inspired cooking evokes the full range of emotions that she awakens in his heart.This segment also includes some wonderful discussions of classic Roman cuisine.So...that's the set-up, and the rest of the book does not disappoint.Unfortunately the book starts slowly, with some awkward writing. But if you hang in through the first twenty pages the writing suddenly turns crisp, the pace quickens, the plot takes some delightful and unanticipated turns; and you find yourself at a banquet, savoring a remarkable meal that's about the awakening and refinement of the only appetite that matters.It's tragic that a book this good is already out of print."

While it is technically a variation of the Cyrano de Bergerac story, it is much less tragic and I found the three central characters to be much more lovable. Tomasso is the good-looking Italian charmer in love with American Laura. He can't cook, but his less good-looking friend Bruno can, so Tomasso uses Bruno's cooking skills to woo Laura. Of course, Bruno is also in love with Laura but she has no idea it's him cooking her all the wonderful meals. The story takes place in Italy with nice descriptions of scenery and food. I like light, chick-lit kinds of books along with serious stuff, and I thought this wasn't stupid or mindless like a lot of romance books. I really enjoyed the first three-quarters of the book, but the last few chapters (and especially the very end) weren't quite as good as the beginning.

I could almost see/hear/smell the street markets as I read the scenes.Alas, I did not get the same sense about the characters in this book; all seemed wooden -- even cartoonish. Laura, especially. The final meeting between Bruno and Laura came across as too contrived and unbelievable.I also agree with another reviewer, in that I didn't see where the Mafia plot was necessary. In fact, it detracted. As did the whole thing with the chef Alain.Finally, I thought the author overdid it with his numerous Italian swear words and curses.

Gil has been accused of bribing city and state politicians, and being connected to organized crime. A stranger joins him, and they begin to leave. Suddenly, Gil shoots this stranger and takes off in his black Mercedes. The police are called, and go to Adrian's house. They find Gil's wife outside, enter the house, and find Gil dead in the den from two shots to his head! [Gardner always played down the background corruption in his stories. The idea of a double murder popped into to my mind.] Chapter 2 provides an example of wrongful conviction, which happens more often than the dramas on TV would suggest. This is an omen for Chapter 3, where Mrs. Gil Adrian, the trophy wife, retains Perry Mason. Laurel doesn't know much about Gil's business, or of any powerful enemies. Does the political establishment want to hang the murder on Laurel and thus bury the scandal? Mason learns the stranger Gil shot was unidentified; all he had was cash, a phony driver's license, and a .22 pistol strapped to his ankle. Wasn't a .22 pistol the weapon of choice for hit men asks Mason? Mason contacts David Niles, a Federal prosecutor, and suggests an alliance. [This never happened in the original series, to my recollection.]Chapter 8 tells of the beating that was given to Paul Drake Jr. after he questions Anselmo Costa in Las Vegas. Perry Mason also visits Las Vegas to ask questions, but learns little more. The preliminary hearing in Chapter 19 is as good as Gardner's best. It tells why a defendant shouldn't wear sunglasses. Chapter 20 explains why getting testimony about 'Karl Braundorff' was important. This led to Janet Coleman, a 'roper' (like Raymond Schindler), who told of Gil Adrian's visit to Las Vegas. Then Anselmo Costa is summoned to the witness stand, but he asserts his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Perry Mason gets a clue from the artist drawings on TV. The bank is subpoenaed to find the last check written by Ralph Adrian, Gil's son, before Ralph was murdered. These clues help to solve the puzzle, and Laurel Adrian is freed.This story brings in updated procedures (the defense gets a list of the prosecutor's witnesses), and mentions the terrible traffic in Los Angeles since the 1960s. But the flavor of the original stories has been lost. Paul Drake has retired, and Perry Mason would be an octogenarian, if still alive. What is missing is a younger lawyer, Perry Jr. or Della Mason, to carry on the father's work. This story is like a good reproduction of an old master like Rembrandt, but in a modern setting. It lacks the dedications that were part of the original series."

Therefore, any fan of Perry Mason will have to accept the disappointment of reading this Mason book by another author of another time. Gardner's style and tone very much that of the thirties and forties, with different terminology and a different level of acceptance regarding how men looked at women.If you are capable of accepting the significant difference in style, then this book can be enjoyed. Some of the characters are changed, for example it is now Paul Drake Jr. doing the investigations and Ray Dallas has replaced Lieutenant Tragg. The hostility between Mason and the police has been replaced by a relationship of mutual respect, within the bounds of their professional rivalry; Ray Dallas and Mason are friends.The story is formulaic of the Mason stories, a man is murdered and his estranged wife is falsely accused of the murder. Mason must piece together a series of sometimes-contradictory clues in order to unmask the guilty and free his client. In true Mason fashion, his questioning of a witness leads to a dramatic courtroom event where the murderer is revealed.Although Gardner wrote many Perry Mason stories and they follow a pattern, there are reasons to always want additional stories. Chastain's effort is a worthy addition to this set, while naturally different, it is still within the bounds of what a Perry Mason story should be."

There are also several excellent appendices, including polite phrases in several languages, common French ballet terms, and 13 ways to call someone a loser in Yiddish.My only concern is that it is somewhat Eurocentric. This is not too surprising since the majority of foreign words and phrases used in English are European in origin, but still - you can count on one hand the non-European phrases. The only Japanese words included are nisei and sensai, and I would have expected wabi-sabi and umami at least to be included as well. There are no phrases from Native American languages, none from Africa or the Middle East. There is a fair amount of phrases from Hindu and Sanscrit, but since there were introduced to the English language during the British occupation of India, I don't know whether they can really be considered foreign phrases."

Schuff ""kristista""",45/46,5.0,1214784000,A MUST FOR EVERY PARENT !!!!,"I purchased this book not knowing much about it. Let me tell you...I am sooo glad that I did !!! I am a single parent of a 5 year old little boy who is very stubborn - every conversation and request is a battle. I have felt like all I do is nag and argue with him and can't even remember the last time that we had a ""good day"". I am very consistent with him and with disciplining, but he still constantly manipulates and argues over everything and it is mentally and physicaly tiring. It has been this way for about a year now and I have been at my wits end. I feel like I have tried every parenting book out there & nothing has worked. UNTIL NOW !! I read this book last week - it was a quick read, about 1 1/2 hours. This book has changed my life and it works !! I love this book because it focuses on only 2 or 3 skills that you can quickly learn and implement. Instead of the typical thick parenting book that is overwhelming and you are not sure where to begin...this book spells it out for you. It gives you DETAILED examples of situations and what to say in these situations. I have only used the techniques for about a week, but it has already changed our lives. My son spent this entire last weekend without arguing with me. I can't remember the last time that happened. We actually were able to spend some great quality time together and were loving and affectionate instead of having a power struggle. My favorite strategies in the book are the ""I know"" , ""Nice try"" and ""I love you too much to argue"". I told all of my friends to buy this book. I can't recommend this book highly enough!!! Thank you Jim Fay - I hope I can meet you to thank you in person someday!!"

Basically, here's what I got out of this book:It's loving to let your children experience the consequences of their own actions. You WANT your children to become strong, responsibly adults--so you need to let them develop the skills they need to succeed on their own.You also want to do so in a way that is LOVING and not coming across as punishing or the bad guy. It's such a tricky act. But once you learn this (and you'll find it VERY successful) you can apply it to your children, your SPOUSE, and your COWORKERS!"

I enjoy sitting down with a 200+ page book, but not so my husband. I have been trying to get him on board with the Love and Logic program, but he will not sit and read a book for that long! So when I saw this book, I thought it might peak his interest enough to get him to read it. This book is much shorter than some of the others and it thoroughly addresses problems associated with discipline. As with all of their books, there are lots of anecdotal stories with clear examples. He still didn't read the whole book, but he did walk away with a better understanding of the methods used. I found it a breeze to read and it was nice to have all of the discipline techniques in one easy to read book. I also think it is a nice follow up to the Love and Logic books. After using Love and Logic for awhile, I have noticed that sometimes I get a little lax and then discipline issues start to creep up again. I keep this book handy just to remind myself to keep up with the program. It is much easier to quickly skim this short book than break out the original love and logic book and search for discipline. since beginning the program almost 2 years ago, parenting has been a lot more fun! I am also a teacher and these are great strategies! Wonderful supplement or stand alone book for Love and Logic!"

If click on ""see my other reviews"" under his name you will see that he has reviewed every book in the Love and Logic series with this rhetoric that is based on complete ignorance. Charles Fay and Foster Cline (founders of Love and Logic) are from Evergreen Colorado - not Colorado Springs and have nothing to do with the whole ""family first"" thing.

Wines,42/42,5.0,961113600,&quot;Dinner at Antoine's: An Intriguing Mystery Set in New Orlea,"&quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; written by Frances Parkinson Keyes is set in New Orleans during Carnival Season in January 1948. It is a mystery that endures the generations. I first read &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; ten years ago in 1990. I enjoyed the book so much that it inspired me to make a trip to the Crescent City. My love for the book has not died since that first reading.The mystery is terrific. When I began my second read of the book in May 2000, I was quickly swept into the plot. I didn't want to stop reading. The book is so well written that the characters, plot and setting come to life before the reader. As Ruth Avery, the main character, sees New Orleans for the first time, I too saw the city for the first time through her eyes. The author gives a complete picture of New Orleans society in 1948 through the many characters that she develops. Joe Racina and his wife Judith are middle class residents. Joe works as a reporter and Judith maintains their home. Judith has chosen not to hire help as she grew up in Connecticut on a farm. To the opposite extreme you have the Lanlande family at the top of society. Other characters include Russell Aldridge, architect; Vance Perrault, doctor; and Tossie Pride, personal maid. &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; is an old fashion murder mystery that in the style of Agatha Christie is full of suspects. Once again I was intrigued until the end as I remained unsure of the murderer's identity until it was revealed. This book is by far the author's best and it makes you beg for a sequel.The added bonus to &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; are the physical descriptions of landmarks in New Orleans. The descriptions are so great that this book could almost be categorized as a travel essay. When I traveled to New Orleans, I used &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; as my guide. I quickly found Antoine's Restaurant and in the restaurant I found the Rex Room, 1840 Room, and Mystery Room just as the restaurant had been described by the author. The French bread, tomato aspic, oysters Foch, flaming pressed duck with cream and brandy, cherries Jubilee, and caf&eacute; brulot all enticingly described by the author can still be found on the menu. I quickly moved on throughout New Orleans finding the Court of the Two Sisters, Caf&eacute; Du Monde, the French Market, Jackson Square, the cathedral, St. Charles Avenue, the Garden District, Audubon Park, and the Metaire Cemetery. My most recent reading of the book has me wanting to return to discover the River Road and to find out if the Bar None Restaurant exists with its barbecued chicken, onion rings and corn fritters. Even if I find that the River Road and Bar None only exist in the author's imagination, she has so aptly described them that I will always feel as if I have actually visited.Reading &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; is the perfect way to spend a weekend when you want to take a luxurious vacation in the comfort of your home."
617,B000GSNTRC,Dinner At Antoine's,,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""",36/40,4.0,994464000,Entertaining tale of old New Orleans,"Half soap, half Agatha Christie mystery, this story of New Orleans in the late 1940s is a charming and compelling story of love, deception, and murder. Populated by a complex and endearing (or repelling) cast of characters, this is an excellent story. (And why isn't it in print?!)Starting off at the restaurant Antoine's, it follows extremely rich playboy Orson Foxworth (yes, that is his real name) introducing his lovely niece Ruth Avery to the rich'n'famous of New Orleans. Among them are the beautiful Amelie Lalande, a self-absorbed but very lovely widow that Foxworth wants as a lover but is willing to marry; Odile St. Amand, Amelie's daughter, who is suffering from a disease she tries to hide; Leonce St. Amand, Odile's philandering husband; Caresse Lalande, Odile's little sister who is on the brink of a full-fledged affair with Leonce; Vance Perrault, a doctor who cares deeply for Odile; Odile's ex-lover, Sabin Duplessis; Joe Racina, a brilliant journalist, and many many others...After a fateful night where Odile's shaking hands cause her to spill wine on herself (similar to a bloodstain), Amelie refuses Foxworth's proposal as she doesn't want to leave her poor invalid daughter alone, and Leonce attempts a seduction. Motives are abundant when Odile is found dead in her bedroom - shot through the heart with a gift from her ex-lover. Many lives and destinies will change (some for the better, some for worse) before Odile's killer finds justice of a sort...The pace is pleasant and gradual, allowing us excellent insight into the characters. The descriptions of luxurious houses, restaurants and clothing (especially clothing!) are evocative and entertaining. No threads are left untangled, and the question of motive and reason is, frankly, as excellent as that of the Grand Mistress of Mystery, Agatha Christie.There is only one thing that kept this from being a five-star book: As it was written in 1948, this book has a rather stereotyped portrayal of African Americans, especially Odile's loving nurse Tossie. Despite the stereotype, I was pleased that Tossie was not played for laughs and was one of the more insightful characters in the story. The reader automatically connects with her (especially regarding her low, low, LOW opinion of Leonce) and is warmed by the last chapter regarding her.Though Ruth Avery is sort of the heroine, she is nevertheless not the central character. She is strong and independent, with little thought of social position; and, after Odile's murder, so is Caresse (whom I expected to hate but ended up liking). I hated Leonce, was charmed by Orson Foxworth and Joe Racina. I found the character of Amelie Lalande to be highly annoying, with her self-centered artificiality.Though there are a few pitfalls in this book, it is nevertheless an entertaining (and pretty clean as well) story about mystery and passion in New Orleans, a beautiful city. Well worth the read."

623,B000GSNTRC,Dinner At Antoine's,,A229U5V2OK7B4D,strickn,1/4,3.0,1186185600,Decoy Mystery,"Picked this recently from Grandmother's shelf; she'd never read it, but her few months living in New Orleans were right around the time of the book. It will be hard for enlightened readers to believe that upper /lower classes would behave and communicate in stereotyped ways; umbrage is mis-taken. Not only can you trust an observant outsider resident of New Orleans writing in 1948 to have a perspective on 1948 New Orleans superior in details to that of postmodern criticism, but it's also easily forgotten by outsiders, even after this hurricane, that, in this city more than any other, people lived their lives in one or two neighborhoods. In other words, life itself was, from an educational standpoint, simplistic and regressive. Craving high-mindedness, a fatalistic New Orleanian you never will be. It's faintly surprising that people want it dressed up. This work sure doesn't oblige (attention to fashion and finery notwithstanding). Most of its characters do suit a place so set'n its ways that, even as the book was being written, leadership was passing to the smaller (later giant), more creative city that would eventually come to N.O.'s aid from a few hundred miles to the west.It would be standard (and a bit inaccurate) to say the setting is a character here. However, I will say something you rarely hear: stories exist so that the author has something on which to put the real communication. Forget the mystery. I'm nogood at figuring them out, yet I did. That's not what to read for. I read to soak in the place, the author's devotion to it, and then it just fits that the most humbly local person, the part of the tapestry the astute reader kept expecting to find dirt on, is revealed to have been good all along."

625,B000GSNTRC,Dinner At Antoine's,,ABSEN74HZBNBK,Martha E. Hopkins,3/9,3.0,1153785600,Very dated and predictable mystery,"I decided to read this book after a visit to New Orleans when I toured the home of the author. The book was mentioned during the tour as one of her most famous books.I can see why it is out of print. I almost quit reading it after 50 pages. To become classics, books need to have universal qualities that transcend time and place. Dinner at Antoines is filled with stereotypes.As another reviewer pointed out, the depiction of blacks in the novel is condescending and dated. They all talk like characters in ""Uncle Remus.""The blacks are not the only ones who talk like caricatures. The policeman Murphy talks like an Irish cop from the movies.Other characters also are stereotypes. They are the ruthless businessman (Foxworth), the shallow woman out for his money (Amelie), the noble statesman (Huntington), the philandering husband (Leonce), the flirt (Caresse), Latin beauty (Clarinda), caring old doctor the tough-talking policeman, the rugged archeologist, etc. None of them seemed real to me.The main women characters are interested only in clothes and men. Ruth is a rich 20-something clothes horse with a silver mink coat. Clarinda is considered an old maid at 27. Caresse goes to New York to become a model for a staid department store. None of them seems to have a brain.The plot also seemed a little creaky to me. I figured out ""who done it"" about half way through the book, even though many characters had a motive and there were clues pointing at several. I also easily figured out who would marry whom at the end.Another plot flaw is tha author does a lot of telling readers about characters and what is going on rather than demonstrating it by action.Most of the plot takes place over a week, yet a murder is comitted and solved, an engagement takes place and is broken and replaced by another, and Ruth agrees to fly to Hondourus marry a man she has known a week.As an example of 1950s race, class, and gender stereotypes taken to an extreme, the book is interesting. It was somewhat entertaining, but totally unbelievable. I did not believe in the world portrayed.That is the main difference between a classic like Agatha Christie's novels and this book. I believe in the worlds Christie creates, though they are set in past times and distant places. However, I feel that Parkinson's New Orleans is an unbelievable place with unbelievable people."

The book makes good on its claim to insightfully delve into the fundamental philosophy of homeopathy. Also, Winston tackles the important and controversial question of scientific rigor that plagues this medical breakthrough. He makes it systematically clear how the medical philosophy of homeopathy is scientifically rigorous. Also mentioned are the innovative medical thinkers known as the original homoeopaths, the decline of homeopathy at the beginning of the 20th century, and the resurgence of this medical philosophy towards the end of this same century. It is ideal for those readers attempting to gain greater medical recognition of homeopathy or for those just interested in the history of this innovative healthcare technique. If one is looking for in-depth inforamtion on homeopathy that is historical, academic, and interesting, then The Faces of Homeopathy is in my opinion the best book to buy."

The answer would be something only an expert can point out, like &quot;Hey you have a newline between your tables in your code. Yes HTML doesn't care about newlines but some browsers do.&quot;Truly this book will answer a lot of questions like that. If you ever are gonna work with HTML or have been working with HTML but haven't read this book, your eyes will be opened either by the fact that you didn't know so many things, or by the fact that a human being could stuff so many facts into a single book.If you are the type who needs a pocket reference maybe you are at the wrong place, but then perhaps you'd demand a pocket reference for building a space craft too! This book is a must for anyone who needs a sense of how web building works.I last encountered this book in 1998 but I just felt like putting it down now, and I still recommend it. There isn't a better book on the subject."

They're supposedly all in the 250-page Appendix A, but to find one you have to go to the Appendix A section in the table of contents at the beginning of this bulky 1100-page tome, look up the page # listed there, then go to that page. The obvious alternative would be phonebook-style page headers showing the first tag name on each page so readers could locate a tag of interest directly. Why wouldn't a tech book publisher have this figured out?The cover says &quot;up-to-date for latest versions&quot; of Netscape and IE without specifying dates or version #'s. The printing date is hidden in the ISBN code. I find this practice questionable.Although pages 7 and 682 say all documents should begin with &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;, this tag does not seem to be fully described anywhere. The syntax suggested on p. 682 (with a single pair of quotes) conflicts with the HTML 4 examples on p. 60.The book cover trumpets &quot;comprehensive&quot; coverage of HTML 4 as well as: &quot;extensive details on Cascading Style Sheets 1 &amp; 2.&quot; One could be forgiven for figuring this means fairly full coverage of CSS. However, the preface draws a distinction between HTML and CSS, speaking of &quot;HTML 4 ... _along with_ new technologies that affect HTML, such as CSS ...&quot; and announces an intention &quot;to do one thing the best I can: cover HTML.&quot; The implicit disclaimer is not idle. Whatever the process that upgraded the previous edition to this one, this book is by no means a comprehensive reference for CSS."

This book is the perfect way to get started if you're interested in pursuing a career in web development or application programming.

There's some sections in the book that probably could quite easily have been cut or shrunk down. I kind of got the feeling that they wanted to stretch the book out to 1200 pages as a marketting ""Look at how huge our book is!"" thing. They probably could have made it ~1000 pages rather easily, which would have made the book easier to handle.In addition, some sections of the book are somewhat outdated.

There are several ways the material could have been organized, and as an experienced HTML writer I would have organized it differently, but I believe the author's organization makes the material more accessible for new and less experienced developers.Any criticisms I may have of this book are very minor compared to the excellent job the author has done with this book, and I would recommend it for anyone who has to write HTML, with or without the aid of an HTML editor."

However, whether folks prefer to &quot;code their own&quot; or use standard HTML editing programs, there are clear advantages of becoming familiar with the basics of HTML programming that will pay dividends in the long run. Not all HTML editors are created equal and sometimes inside knowledge is helpful in the Web development process.HTML: The Complete Reference is a huge 2 1/4 - inch book packed with helpful and important HTML Web design information. Here readers will take in a broad scope of Website programming features that will improve, freshen up, and add functionality to any Website. Learn how to use fonts, colors, backgrounds, frames, tables, layers, style sheets, client-side programming, plug-ins, audio and video clips, and more. Plenty of scripting examples are provided to permit immediate results in the Website design process.This reference book includes all the latest tags, Web browser and programming compatibility considerations, and background information needed to produce outstanding Websites. The book reads better as a reference guide than a novel. However, one can learn quite a bit by simply thumbing through it on a casual basis. A particular Web design feature could leap out from a page and arouse interest that could lead to a great design idea!This book recommended for experienced programmers only, who are well acquainted with the in's and out's of Web design concepts.

I am truly impressed at what I found here. I purchased several books on related topics (javascript and such) and after reading all of them, this book was, by far, the easiest to use. Mr. Powell's writing style allowed me to retain more than I expected I would. I immediately put into use many of these tags to take my website from average to very efficient (and cool if I do say so myself). The reference section allows me to quickly find more about the tag I am trying to use. Don't let the enormous size of this book intimidate you. It reads easy and a great deal of the book is reference relating back to what you learned earlier.If you are using a WYSISYG editor to make your website and want to get past those limitations.

The next 475 pages provide a well-organized presentation of HTML mechanics including presentation, layout, cascading style sheets, client/server side programming, DHTML, XML, and web hosting. Throughout this material, sample code is presented and explained to illustrate the concepts presented. Finally, 430 pages of appendices provide reference level detail that will remain valuable indefinitely.The later chapters (programming, DHTML, XML) are overview in nature. (ASP is discussed in five pages.) This is appropriate, for each of these subjects requires a text of their own. The overviews are valuable as they present these subjects in the context of HTML and how they can work together. They also give the reader a basic platform from which to study in greater detail.Certainly worth mentioning also are the numerous tips and valuable remarks sprinkled throughout the book. In my case there were several one-line statements worth the purchase price.This book is a well-written and thorough text that a beginner can use to learn HTML and an advanced web developer can use as a reference or to polish up.

A smaller book that puts more emphasis on &quot;teaching&quot; the basic concepts than providing an extensive reference resource.

Individuals working to improve company intranet and extranet communications will be well-served by the examples given of code and scripting followed by what you can expect to see. Professionals seeking guidance in advanced HTML, DHTML, XML, and related internet savvy can expect to increase their understanding of these cutting-edge technologies.We found excellent coverage of the pitfalls of page preparation without knowledge of the differences between popular browser capabilities. The browser versions expected to be in common use for the next few years of Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, WebTV, and a few others, and how to allow for their different interpreting capabilities , is covered throughout the book.Hundreds of pages of appendixes explain what you can and can't do with HTML elements and style sheets. The function, power, and use of Java Script in its several variations are explained with examples. Author Thomas A. Powell, an expert Web consultant and Internet applications teacher at University of California at San Diego, explains the centrality of HTML while predicting changes that XML and other methods may bring in the future. He cites lots of free online Web sites, at all levels, to augment material in the book.We found the writing style, loaded with useful examples and stabs of humor, to be an easy read. This is a body of knowledge that must be understood at higher than an entry level by industrial, academic, and small business practitioners alike who see the need for an effective Web presence."
653,B0000630MU,HTML: The Complete Reference,,,,7/7,3.0,966124800,Not Good Enough,"I bought this book based on the Amazon Reviews and after using it I must disagree with the weight of on-line opinion. Not that it is a bad book. It just isn't what the reviews led me to expect. My main disappointment is the poor structure and organization. It has a thrown-together feel, more like a collection of separate and poorly integrated sections than a single well-organized book.Some examples: Even after marking the page edges it is still difficult to find what I want quickly. The text sections are only average and not at all comprehensive. To learn HTML or CSS, you'd be better off getting a book (or books) that is not trying to be everything at once. And the reference sections are also a disappointment. The main headers do not stand out from the repeated subheadings so one becomes lost easily. There is not enough detail on differences between the major browsers. The CSS &quot;reference&quot; is a mess. It is broken into subsections which disrupt the alphabetical order and is sorely lacking in the kind of detail that is critical to successful style-sheet implementation.As I said, it's not a bad book. It's just not good enough. For total newbies, Castro's QuickStart Guide is far superior. On CSS, try O'Reilly's &quot;definitive&quot; guide. Not sure what to recommend as an HTML reference. I'm going to try Goodman's &quot;Dynamic HTML.&quot;"

I checked the errata section of the website but not a single error in the book was listed there (at the time of writing this). I can't believe they are unaware of them, especially as this book has been out for several months now.Secondly the author keeps plugging his other book, so much so that he includes an entire chapter from that book here. Although it may of had some relevance I don't think it should of been added, as in my opinion it was clearly intended as a promotion of his other publication. I certainly don't object to being made aware of an authors publications, for instance in a list at the end of the book, but not like this.On the plus side this book does cover HTML exceptionally well, all the expected stuff like frames, tables, layers, forms, links, media types etc are explored. XHTML is also covered but don't expect much, the differences are only in the rules of writing the language, which are explained. Note that there isn't a chapter dedicated to XHTML but you are made aware of the differences between HTML mark-up and XHTML mark-up when necessary.Like previous editions this book does cover a lot of theory, e.g. logical versus physical mark-up, protocols, mime types, parsed html etc.There is also a chapter dedicated to CSS1 and CSS2 which is pretty complete. The CSS2 section includes coverage on the various new pseudo elements and selectors introduced in CSS2. There is also a reference section covering CSS1 and CSS2 at the back of the book, and it includes proprietary properties for Internet Explorer.SSI is also covered in this book. There are also very basic introductions to XML, JavaScript, server side technologies and DHTML. These are more about what they can do as opposed to teaching you them.The reference section has been organised alphabetically this time, so it is much easier to use than previous editions. They include coverage of XHTML, additions to WebTV, JavaScript event handlers and the usual HTML stuff. There are also reference sections for colour codes and character entities.Finally this is the first Complete Reference book I have purchased that didn't fall apart, so there is no need to buy a binder this time around."

For example, the structure of an Internet Protocol address is covered twice in two separate sections, for a total of 10+ pages. I find that addressing has been adequately covered in other HTML books in 2-3 pages. As another example, the author mentions a trick of prefetching an image by rendering it with a height of 1 and width of 1. This trick is mentioned in full detail (paragraphs) twice in two seperate sections.The author seems to feel that every chapter should be complete in that it covers all tricks. For a reader who reads several chapters at a time, sections become redundant.

The biggest flaw in this book, however, is the lack of emphasis on XHTML. The cover boasts that it includes full XHTML within it; however, it is really only one chapter out of the whole book. As someone who likes to keep up with the W3C standards and current technology on web pages, I have found that out of this entire book, I really only use chapter 13 which is on style sheets. I read the book and got to this chapter only to realize that everything I had just read wasn't information I could use.This book also includes an introduction to other aspects of HTML such as JavaScript and Server Side Programming, as well as, web maintenance. However, it only serves as an introduction and points the reader to other books. This book is great as an overview, but it does a poor job at helping you move from reading about HTML to actually doing the current HTML you would see on your favorite website.I would recommend finding a book on CSS and XHTML that gives a short introduction to the basics of HTML and then gives more emphasis on the current technology being used."

It really does contain everything I can think I would need to write HTML code at any level of complexity or depth, and I've been writing HTML code since 1994, professionally since around 1997. If you're a beginner, the book spends some time in the beginning teaching you the basics and concepts, everything you should need to get started on your first pages. And if you're a novice or expert, the book will scale to your level of knowledge gracefully, it covers the gamut, even extending into Cascading Style Sheets, Dynamic HTML and a brief introduction to XML (if you need an XML manual you should get one dedicated only to XML, this reference is not complete for that purpose). The title couldn't be more appropriate, as inside the book, there is a complete reference of every single valid HTML tag and attribute you could use, even including explanations for what each attribute means! If you get just one HTML book, get this one.Keep in mind that this book does not cover any WYSIWYG tools for creating HTML pages (such as FrontPage or Dreamweaver).

However only the first few hundred pages cover HTML, and it's covered extremely well to. If you have read any other book on HTML then you won't believe just how much has been missed out until you read this book. HTML is much bigger than you would have ever thought.The book teaches you a lot of theory, areas such as logical and physical structure, doctype definitions, media types, encoding types (to name but a few) are explored, and the usual tutorials on tables, frames, linking, image maps, graphics, meta tags etc are all there, but more information is provided.There is also a chapter dedicated to style sheets which covers both CSS1 and CSS2. As HTML 4.0 encourages you to use style sheets instead of standard HTML, it was good to see this chapter. This was my first exposure to CSS and I'm very confident using it now. I don't believe you will have to buy an additional book on CSS.Other chapters include introductions to other technologies like JavaScript, server side programming, XML and DHTML, but these are only basic introductions, do not expect to learn these technologies from those chapters, they just give you a taste.The remainder of the book consists of the reference sections. These throughly cover (among other things) HTML and CSS. The HTML section includes additional tags and attributes specific to each browser, including those for webTv. Character encoding is also covered.I have only two criticisms of this book. Firstly it falls apart in your hands, so if you buy it expect to buy a binder as well.

This band deals with the first true encounter between the fledgling fleet of Terra and the might of the galactic empire.In ""The Cosmic Decoy"" we are reunited with Cadet Julian Tifflor, whom we met in the Mutant Master trilogy of stories. Cadet Tifflor is chosen by Perry Rhodan to become a Cosmic Decoy. At least four of the ships of the Terranian fleet have disappeared, and Rhodan wants to know where they went.In just the first book, we discover that the four missing ships were stolen by the Springers, a race of space-faring traders with no morals other than their own. Julian is prepared for this mission with a ""secret"" message - and a hidden special transmitter that is only capable of being received by people with telepathic powers, such as several members of Rhodan's Mutant Corps. Even Tifflor is unaware that he is a living psychic transmitter. According to plan, Tifflor is kidnapped by the Springers, but he is whisked away to a secret base before Rhodan and his men can catch up. We meet a few of the Springers and begin the process via which Rhodan plans to make the universe believe that the Earth has been destroyed.Next episode - Number 23 - ""Fleet of the Springers"".I've never been this impressed by a series. I'm reminded of old cliffhanger serials like ""Buck Rodgers"" or ""Flash Gordon"" when reading these marvelous books. This series is still being published in Germany and is now well over 2,000 stories. It's too bad American publishers stopped after only about 120 books. I had to learn to speak, read, and write German in order to continue reading Perry Rhodan.This book contains another editorial, another science fiction movie section, and another letters column. There are also extra stories - one continuing adventure, similar to a serial, and some ""Shock Shorts"" - continuing a series of SF short stories at the end of each book. Although these stories have nothing to do with Perry Rhodan, they are worth looking at.It's well worth reading the entire Rhodan series."

Each character feels out of place in society and clings to each other only to find that they are even out of place with each other.After drifting apart for a few years, their parents take action to bring them together. They orchestrate a dinner to celebrate the life of Princess Diana and watch the live coverage of her funeral. During the course of the dinner, Justin is outed, Tien's fiance is knocked unconscious, everyone is ashamed when it occurs to them that they forgot Gibbo's birthday. And to top it off, the food is awful!Despite this disastrous dinner, it sets a series of events in motion to reconcile not only the three friends, but the families. In the worst of times, Justin's in a coma, Tien is getting divorced, and Gibbo is accused of being a stalker, they all come together to support each other.This book is captivating from the start and is wonderfully written. The author takes you on a journey with each character, bringing depth and perspective to the series of events. I came away from this book having learned something about people, life and relationships. For instance:Tien's mother, Lihn, in love with a black American solider, is rejected by her family for her love. In a letter to her father, she quotes a Vietnamese author I'd never heard of before, Nguyen Du:""It blows one day & rains the nextHow often does chance favor us in the Spring?If you ignore and scorn my desperate loveyou'll hurt me- yet what will it profit you?""The Tale of KieuThis passage struck me as relevant to my own life as many of my friends are in the stage of life where they are deciding who to spend the rest of their lives with. Not everyone is making good choices, in my opinion, and it's always difficult to know when you should speak up to prevent disaster and when to let people make their own mistakes. There were other passages and messages in this book that were thought provoking and had me reflecting on my life.As good of a book as this was, I still have to give it an overall rating of a 4-stars because of the ending. It was a little too....... happily ever after, for my taste."

It is basically a story about three friends with multi-cultural backgrounds. Justin Cheong is a Chinese-Australian who is the picture-perfect son. His world becomes increasingly unstable as he comes to terms with his attraction to other men. Tien is the child of a Vietnamese woman and an African-American soldier. Living with her aunt and uncle in Australia, she straddles worlds of identity between Asian culture, Australian culture and wondering about her American father. Gibbo is a Caucasian Australian whose culture serves as a foil to the Asian. Overweight, Gibbo lacks confidence. He bonds with Justin & Tien as outcasts.Teo sets up the classic ""No Exit"" triangle where Justin loves Gibbo, Gibbo loves Tien, and Tien loves Justin. After the elementary to high school years, the friends draw apart. Justin goes camping with Gibbo with unfortunate results. Tien goes to prom with Gibbo with unfortunate results. The novel reunites them toward the end of college @ the Dead Diana Dinner (DDD) where relatives gather to morn the loss of the British princess and watch her funeral on TV. Here, the parents begin to take center stage and we go through their history. Gibbo's mom has been like a mother to Tien, but backs off when Tien's mother Linh finally arrives in Australia from Vietnam, via a Malaysian refugee camp. Gibbo's dad is a brusque medical doctor who gets upset with Justin's dad Tek and spills the beans about Justin's sexual orientation. Meanwhile, everyone has forgotten that this is also the meek Gibbo's 21st birthday. Tien plans to announce her engagement to Stanley, but Gibbo's mom knocks him out thinking she's caught an intruder.From the DDD, the novels spends several chapter in flashback as we learn all about Linh's history and her love affair with American GI Bucky. We also flash forward to see Tien in San Francisco with her husband Stanley and follow them through his modern art phase and Tien's flirtation with a new age feminist group that enjoys giving themselves haircuts in private places. Justin's life resembles that country song, ""Looking for love in all the wrong places."" Meanwhile, Gibbo develops an unwelcome attachment to Linh.This episodic novel sounds a bit melodramatic, but reads well. The characters are distinct and interesting, although none are perfect. Teo tries wax philosophical about the weaving of relationships into a lifetime pattern. For me, the Asian cultural self-analysis was interesting as people from various cultural backgrounds try to establish their own roots. Enjoy!"

However, Rabbi Lawrence Kushner draws this title from the Torah, the book of Genesis to be precise. It is the exclamation of Jacob who, upon waking from his dream about the ladder connecting heaven and earth, makes a startling realisation about the reality of the seemingly mundane and ordinary place where he had stopped for the night.In the prologue, Kushner develops an exegesis and hermeneutic of Genesis 28:16 more fully, and in so doing, illustrates many of the problems we regularly encounter, both in reading scripture as well as in interpreting daily life experience. He places this story in strong connection with the ordinary, even relating the angels on the ladder to common humanity:`There is another, even more obvious interpretation. The angels did not reside in heaven at all. They lived on earth. They were ordinary human beings. And, like ordinary human beings, they shuttled back and forth between heaven and earth. The trick is to remember, after you descend, what you understood when you were high on the ladder.'Kushner examines the way in which sages have interpreted this passage, and provides insights into history, psychology, philosophy, and scriptural study in the process. Each interpretation has had what one might call a personal conversation and experience with Jacob. In fact, each of these interpreters is portrayed as being on the ladder, rising and descending. The text is structured in this way. The interpreters are:+RashiSchelomo ben Yitzhaki, RashiThe key word for this interpretation is awareness. This is very important for making the kind of realisation that Jacob made. It is very important for us as we perceive the presence of God in our own lives.If I had known God was here, I wouldn't have gone to sleep.+KotzkMenachem Mendl of KotzkThe key concept here is egotism. Only by stripping away the ego can one begin to understand the presence and the personality of God.God was here because I was able to subdue my ego.+LudomirHannah Rachel Werbermacher, the Maid of LudomirA remarkable woman, a teacher of the Hasidim (who listened to her teaching through a half-open door, so as to preserve distance, and perhaps preserve a fiction that they were not in fact being taught by a woman), whose insight gave her access to the other side, or the many other sides, of stories being considered.God is present, even in the midst of evil.+MezritchDov Baer, the Maggid of MezritchThe word Maggid means 'storyteller'. Through the stories, here the key is self-reflection, to find meaning in the innermost being, to find that still, small voice that can only speak in silence and the absence of our own activity.God was here because I stopped being aware of myself.+NachmaniShmuel bar MachmaniWho was Jacob, and why should he know this? Who is God, and why should God do this? These are questions that are historical as much as theological or psychological, and it is in our history and God's history that we find meaning and identity.I could have climbed this ladder of history.+De LeonMoses ben Shem Tov de LeonA remarkable book, lost for a time, whose existence was denied even by Moses de Leon's widow, the Zohar, gives astonishing insight into the interior of God, reality, and our selves, and how to find a deep connection that is always present and never finished. Attributed to another author, Shimon bar Yohai, Kushner speculates that perhaps they shared the same soul. The completeness of the self of the universe connects through Jacob's story here.I is the Lord your God+OstropolShimshon ben Pesach OstropolerBeyond the question and awareness of the self of God and the self of the universe is the self, basic and simple, complex and intricate. Rabbi Shimshon put names to the kelipot, the broken shards of creation. We are all a part of a whole, a broken piece in and of ourselves. Our awareness of this helps begin the process of reunion.I didn't know that my name was part of God's nameEach interpreter's chapter stands on its own merits, but each is connected to the other, and to a wider body of interpretation and scholarship, by the use of side notes and references done in (what I would describe as being) a proto-talmudic structure. The Talmud has been described by some as one of the world's first hypertexts, with cross-links and chains that lead through the text -- this book does similar linking.Rabbi Kushner concludes by linking all the stories to the reader:`Each person has a Torah, unique to that person, his or her innermost teaching. Some seem to know their Torahs very early in life and speak and sing them in a myriad of ways. Others spend their whole lives stammering, shaping and rehearsing them. Some are long, some are short. Some are intricate and poetic, others are only a few words, and still others can only be spoken through gesture and example. But every soul has a Torah.'The relative place of self (both as an I and as an i) in God's life and universe becomes more apparent through these stories. Human beings are important, yet who can be important in relation to God? Yet, who is not important in relation to God? May this work help you discern where God is in your life, and what you are called to be."
695,B0006P6WSS,"God was in this place & I, i did not know: Finding self, spirituality, and ultimate meaning",,A3PJFOIP93JGPE,"Steven Marks ""Prog Harpo""",17/18,5.0,995155200,The hand of God,"As you have gathered from the main review, this book focuses on the meaning of just one verse in Genesis, when Jacob awoke from the ladder dream. Usually Rabbis pick up on a verse just a couple verses back where &quot;the Angels of God were going up and down the ladder&quot;. The focus is that they start on Earth and go to Heaven - not the other way around.This book is great because it is like there is a dialog accross the space-time continuumn with 7 Rabbis in different locations and centuries arguing about their 7 different interpretations.One interpretation based on the fact that there are two &quot;I's&quot; in the verse spelled differently in Hebrew. It is that my Godlike &quot;I&quot; did not know God was present because my ego &quot;i&quot; was in the way. Jacob's chance to experience God was diminished because the ego &quot;i&quot; was ragiling off its commentary. This concept is similar to Buddism.Kushner adds an 8th interpretaion in his prolouge - which I won't spoil by going into detail. I heard Kushner talk at a Synagouge in Austin, Texas and he summarized his interpretation by finishing, &quot;Hold up your hands before your eyes. You are looking at the hands of God.&quot;A great book on modern Jewish mystism."
696,B0006P6WSS,"God was in this place & I, i did not know: Finding self, spirituality, and ultimate meaning",,A2MHUSO8C0XO23,J. Miller,13/13,5.0,1144368000,Poetic and Intelligent,"Kushner walks us through the exegetical vantage points of seven different rabbis, each looking at the same text. Jacob awakes from a dream about a ladder (Gen 28:16), and declares that he has experienced God. Kushner then poetically imagines the seven rabbis ascending and descending the ladder to teach us how to read the text. What results is a beautifully poetic look at the biblical text itself, a clever mode of teaching us Jewish history and midrash, and a fully postmodern system of acknowledging the existence of multiple perspectives. As with Kushner's other works (cf. Jewish Spirituality) it evolves into a mystical climax in which the reader and text are equated.The seven are:1. Rashi (Rabbi Shelomo ben Yitzhaki, @1050). He calls us to focus on the literal text without distraction, without background noise. He says that the real miracle of the burning bush required Moses to pay attention for more than a minute to realize that it was not burning (p. 24).2. Kotzk (Menachem Mendl of Kotzk, 1787-1859). He said that we needed to destroy our egos and should begin by calling ourselves liars (p. 38, 54). We should do this through gemilut hasidim, acts of selflessness (p. 51). Kotzk later in life condemned himself to solitude, only occasionally stepping onto his balcony to yell into the crowd, ""You are all liars!""3. Ludomir (Hannah Rachel Werbermacher, 1805-1892). The only woman on the list, she called us to see that God was there even in the midst of evil. Teaching men through a half open door (p. 58), she taught them that God does not intervene in human affairs without human agency (p. 62). In fact, we are to assume that the fall in the garden was an act of God. God was present with Jacob in the angel that wrestled with him.4. Mezritch (Dov baer of Mezritch, d. 1772). He says that the goal of the religious life is devekut, cleaving to God (p. 84). Forced to follow a monk whose job it is to wash dishes (p. 87), he discovers that the purpose of life is to escape self-reflection to throw one's self whole-heartedly into one's role. Otherwise, as in a game of racquetball (p. 89), the self is always distracted when it focuses on anything other than its purpose. The self then becomes fragmented, with one part looking back at the rest to analyze its existence. ""Too much concentration can be worse than none at all"" (p. 90). We should be like the husband whose quest it is to find the right food for the pregnant wife in the middle of the night (p. 103). The ""I did not know"" of the Genesis text really refers to not paying attention to the ""I.""5. Nachmani (Samuel bar Nachmani, late 3rd c.). He sees in the story the issue of Jacob needing to become part of history, to take hold of history and enter into it.6. De Leon (Moses be Shem Tov de Leon, 1240-1305). De Leon wrote out a book called the Zohar (p. 130), and though he attributed it to a long-dead rabbi, he seems to have produced it himself. He says that the we are to accept who we are and put aside the veil of deceptive pseudo-identities. God's primary activity is to free us from the slavery to those self-deceptions. If God had a business card, the subline would read, ""Frees slaves,"" and then ""Call anytime"" (p. 144). God is the sense of self, the ""I,"" the Anochi, which is free.7. Ostropol (Shimson ben Pesach Ostropoler, d. 1648). He would say that it should be read, ""God was in this place and I did not know it was i."" We are somehow an indispensable part of God (p. 173). To look at your own hands is to look at the hands of God (p. 174). Somehow Abraham's father Terah was redeemed by the activities of Abraham himself. There is an old legend of Abraham smashing Terah's idols, and the conclusion is that the idolatries are redeemed by the son who is a part of him.The conclusion is that the text can be read legitimately through multiple lenses, and as we do so, our eyes are increasingly opened by and to the text. God may speak in any number of ways through our interaction with the text.It's a brilliant book, unlike most, both poetic and intelligent."

709,B0008852GG,The soul of man under socialism,,A1AWIMIVWGIER,Dana Garrett,2/4,3.0,1338249600,Oscar Wilde: Theory on a Holiday,"Oscar Wilde's The Soul of Man under Socialism depicts the tangential and unintended callousness of socialistic thinking when it is merely theoretical and future-based and is not also activist, revolutionary and focused on the present.Wilde understands perfectly well that one of the principal goals of socialism is the elimination of poverty: ""The proper aim is to try and reconstruct society on such a basis that poverty will be impossible."" That might be the aim, but what should be done in the meantime to alleviate the suffering of the poor? In a word, the answer for Wilde is ""nothing."" He argues that charitable attempts to help the poor both fail to help the poor but also ""prolong"" the disease that cause poverty. The disease, of course, is the system of capitalistic exploitation. It is wrongheaded, Wilde argues, to use the fruits of capitalism to redress the consequences of its rampages: ""It is immoral to use private property in order to alleviate the horrible evils that result from the institution of private property. It is both immoral and unfair."" While Wilde is confident that the ravages of poverty will cease in a future socialistic society, he opposes all palliatives for the poor and oppressed in the meantime. That is one of the consequences of confining socialistic thought to merely theoretical and future-based considerations and failing to also make it activist, revolutionary and focused on the present.Wilde's socialism of ""voluntary association"" of the future is individualistic (individuals should be free to choose their own work), anti-authoritarian, and government-less (largely anarchical). In fact, Wilde sees authoritarian socialism as constituting a worse state of affairs than capitalistic exploitation: ""If the Socialism is Authoritarian; if there are Governments armed with economic power as they are now with political power; if, in a word, we are to have Industrial Tyrannies, then the last state of man will be worse than the first.""Wilde extols the prospects of an anti-authoritarian socialistic society because of its potential to actualize individuality. But Wilde's individualism has a kind of hierarchy about it--one, it is impossible to fail to notice, that leaves persons like himself at the top: ""These are the poets, the philosophers, the men of science, the men of culture--in a word, the real men, the men who have realised themselves, and in whom all Humanity gains a partial realisation."" Apparently, those given to other vocations are not quite as ""real"" and can only partially realize these Olympian heights.Soon Wilde's discussion of individualism acts as an unstable catalyst, causing him to veer into a wide variety of topics often inexplicably. But the topics that preoccupy him for most of the work are aesthetic and literary concerns, especially as they relate to the relationship between individualism and artistic expression. While this discussion has some merit and interest, it is difficult to imagine why these peevish considerations require the lengthy treatment they receive in a work entitled ""The Soul of Man under Socialism.""My reservations about Wilde's work notwithstanding, I do think this is a relatively important work to read. While the work as a whole lacks a coherence that could have made it more effective, many individual passages are keenly insightful and highly quotable."

Capital ""I"" on individualist.I couldn't find a date for this writing, but I believe his legal problems and the rumors preceding his legal problems were actually the motivation, and not economics or politics.As many artists and I consider myself one, believe their work and their life are one. Oscar showed his colors as far as common people go. I could not imagine him an equal to a chimney sweep or a waiter.Oscar was hurt and he was attempting to argue that life style, and art, especially his, should be free from the common people's rules.

I became a fan of Christine Feehan only a few months ago and I hope she continues to write often as I have enjoyed all of her novels so far. This story was very enjoyable and interesting. I enjoyed the interaction between the two main characters and also some of the secondary characters, especially the children. It was a little predicatable, but there is still a quality in Christine Feehan's writing that grabs you and keeps you interested... and wishing that it had not ended!The only compliants I have is that one of the brothers characters was undeveloped to the point that it did not make sense, as well as the &quot;special gifts&quot; that both the main characters had. The authors seemed to imply some power beyond ESP, but yet never expanded or provided any sort of explanation for these &quot;gifts&quot;.I am really looking forward to the next novel. I hope it will be a continuation (perhaps the Don's brother?) of this story. I am also still hoping for more vampire romances as well!"

He has &quot;gifts&quot; of his own. Nicoletta isn't immediately enchanted with the idea of marriage to the Don. Unlike some authors, who use the &quot;I hate you!&quot; temper tantrum to ignite passion between the main characters, Ms. Feehan uses the empathy and sensitivity of her characters to achieve it. The love scenes are wonderful, though not very plentiful. So if you're looking for the same amount and intensity of love scenes as in the Dark books, you may be dissappointed.

It doesn't have Vampires or Carpathiansin it but the lack of those doesn't diminish this book one bit. This is the story of the village healer, a beautiful girl names Nicoletta and the Fierce, dark and cursed Don Giovanni Scarletti. Nicoletta comes to the Scarletti family home which is known by its nickname Palazzo della Morte, or in English palace of death, to help save Giovanni's young niece. She also has to treat him as he is ill also. She is strangly drawn to him even though she resists. After she returns to the village the Don envokes his right of choosing his bride from the villages on his land. She tries to hide but he finds her and makes her his bride. Together they must fight the evil that is threatening to kill them both and over come the Curse. There is many instances of humor and I found myself wanting to read more after the book was done.

The story centers around the curse on the Scarletti's, where the women they love end up dead, and where most women who come to the Palazzo Scarletti die, including Nicoletta's mother and aunt. Nicoletta (a healer), herself, is chosen via bride contract by the Don Scarletti (a Telepath), and the story developed from there, with many twists and turns. The characters were well developed and the story line kept you guessing until the end. I was so hooked that I finished it in one night, the same night I got it through the mail.Christine has done it again. I picked up the &quot;Scarletti Curse&quot;, uncertain on what I would find. On one hand, she has been consistent in writing books with great character development and great story lines in her &quot;Dark&quot; series about the Carpathians. On the other, this was a non-Carpathian book, though a Gothic, so I did not know whether she could make the transition. She made the transition extremely well and created another keeper for my keeper shelf.Christine has proven that she can write differently and Scarletti Curse was refreshingly interesting. I am anticipating and hoping that she will expand this into a series. (Spoiler here: Christine has hinted that Nicoletta and Giovanni have some relation to her Carpathian series. I look forward to her exploring that in more detail)I really hope that Christine explores Antonello's character. He was a secondary character and very mysterious, the only character that Christine did not explore in depth. He quite fascinated me. I would also like to see some explanation as to where Giovanni and Antonello got their telepathic abilities.Thank you, Christine! Keep up the great work, and I hope that the publisher will release a lot more books of your books A LOT faster, as I will buy every one."

True, it had a lot more sex than Victoria Holt or other gothic writer favorites ever included in their books, but it didn't take away from my enjoyment.Nicolette is a free spirit with a secret. She was born with the gift of healing and knowing when somebody needed her.The villagers depend on her healing skills and rally around her to keep her hid from outsiders. They know Nicolette could be burned as a witch, otherwise. Don Giovanni, the dark brooding aristocrat, wants Nicolette the first time he sees her. Though his family lives under a curse that all of their women will die, he is determined to make Nicolette his bride.I don't believe in giving too much information in a review so I won't say what happens between them. The book is very atmospheric with the castle and it's sinister wall carvings, the brothers and grandfather who have all lost their wives, and last but not least, the hero with his own gift. One thing I liked about the hero is he was arrogant, but not overly so. He had a soft, gentle side that overshadowed his arrogance, at least to me. I hate heros who are overly arrogant simply because they are men.This was my first book by this author and I am looking forward to reading Dark Prince, another book I have by her."

Christine's style and gift for writing wonderful heroes and heroines along with a fascinating story is not lost. Nicoletta is a strong, compassionate, courageous heroine that learns to make the best of a frightening and seemingly hopeless situation. She is forced into marriage with the mysterious Giovanni Scarletti, who's reputation of darkness and danger strikes fear in the hearts of most in her village. To make matters worse once married she will be forced to live in the cursed Scarletti palazzo secretly nicknamed the &quot;Palazzo Della Morte&quot; where few women who enter manage to escape with their lives. Despite her hesitation she soon discovers there is a powerful attraction between she and Giovanni and seeks to unravel the mystery surrounding her own mother's death in the castle years ago. Is Giovanni the monster her fellow villagers whispered he was or could there be much more to him than she first imagined? Giovanni is just the type of hero I enjoy, like the heroine he is one that can both frighten me yet manage to touch my heart at the same time. The story kept me on the edge of my seat. For fans of the paranormal there is that aspect as well. Nicoletta is gifted with a healing power and Giovanni has the power to speak directly into your mind.

Her compassionate nature and youthful innocence is quite endearing. Giovanni's character is such a mystery which makes you want to know him and his family even more.

THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a true gothic romance, and people who love gothics--like me--will definitely want to read it.The book has elements that were in Feehan's vampire novels and which will be familiar to that audience: telepathy; a dictatorial hero (the curse of the Scarlettis is that they're supposedly destined to kill the women they love in jealous rages); the heroine with REALLY long hair; destiny. There's also the quintessential gothic palace--poetically called the &quot;Palace della Morte&quot; by the local villagers--with hideous artwork, secret passageways, etc., etc., whose inhabitants all seem to be up to something nefarious.I quickly became completely engrossed in the story. No, it's not terribly original, but I loved every turn in the plot, anyway. The story is told very much from the heroine's point of view, which is appropriate, and all the other characters were well filled-out and suited for their purpose in the book. The reason I'm giving THE SCARLETTI CURSE four stars instead of five, however, is that the book, while enjoyable, did have some problems. For example, the love scenes seemed emotionless and out of place in the novel, which was odd because Feehan usually excells at love scenes. I also thought the explanation for everything happening at the &quot;Palace della Morte&quot; didn't quite make sense.Despite these two things, however, I thoroughly enjoyed THE SCARLETTI CURSE, and I think Christine Feehan has found her niche! I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the work of Ann Radcliffe, Mary Stewart, the Brontes, or even Lisa Jane Smith. Definitely, a good read."

My feelings have nothing to do with Ms. Feehan's writing style. I so love Christine's Dark series, I feared that I would inevitably begin to make comparisons and would find this book a major disappointment. It wasn't.There is a terrible curse which plagues the Scarletti men. Every woman who enters the Palazzo as a bride winds up dead. What or . . . whom is causing these fatal accidents?Nicoletta is a healer who possesses &quot;special&quot; gifts. Deep within her being she senses when someone needs her. She is drawn to the great Palazzo knowing that there is a young girl inside who is desperately ill. Once inside those forbidding walls, she encounters Don Giovanni Scarletti known as Il Demonico (The demon).He is dark, brooding and utterly dangerous. Nicoletta instinctively senses the potential threat he poses to her yet she is drawn to him as he is to her. Even the knowledge of his dark and deadly reputation cannot sever the attraction from growing.Don Scarletti also possesses his own &quot;gifts&quot; and chooses her for a bride. What initially begins as a duty for Nicoletta turns into passion than into love. Will Nicoletta suffer the same fate as others have? Or will her unwavering love and ulfaltering courage finally bring an end to the family's deadly curse?You have to read the book in order to find out those answers and more. Enjoy!"

Whispers of evil, murder and insanity have been going around the villagers about the family that rules their lands. They say that no bride has ever survived in the palazzo, and considering the number of women who have met their untimely death in what everyone has come to refer to as the Palazzo Della Morte (Palace of Death), it seemed that the curse is true.Unbeknown to the villagers, the current don has set his eyes on their healer, Nicoletta, the woman whose identity they have protected for fear that she will be branded a witch by those who might misinterpret her gift of healing. So how did Don Giovanni Scarletti find out about their beloved Nicoletta when no one has spoken of her to outsiders? Could the rumor be true then that he has powers because he is in league with the devil?THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a dark and mysterious novel filled with suspense and sensuality. Nicoletta is a very likable heroine, with her wit and exuberance. I loved the way she seemed to embrace life with such open arms. Her compassionate nature and youthful innocence is quite endearing. Giovanni's character is such a mystery. The way he treats Nicoletta with such tenderness is such a contrast from how people perceived him to be.I must say though that even though the author has done well in describing the atmosphere within the palazzo, including the design and architecture lending to the eeriness of the story, there were some parts that dragged a bit. I also didn't care much about the political intrigue, and thought that it wasn't blended in well with the story. I might have understood it more had the author bothered to actually tell us which date the story was meant to have happened (I'm only guessing 15th or 16th century). I know this seems trivial, but when I'm reading a historical novel, I do like to know what period it's supposed to be.Overall, this wasn't a bad book. I did enjoy the banter between the don and his barefoot bride. You can read about Giovanni and Nicoletta's descendant, Antonietta Scarletti, in Dark Symphony (which I'm reading at the moment)."

They keep this charade to prevent the people at the palazzo knowing about Nicoletta's extraordinary healing powers (this heritage is explained in the Carpathian book ""Dark Symphony, in which the lifemate is a descendant of the main characters/couple). As Maria Pia is a midwife herself this causes no problem.At the palazzo the patients turned out to be Don Giovanni Scarletti and his niece Sofia, suffering from food poisoning. While both ""healer"" and assistant do their work, Don Scarletti keeps observing Nicoletta, asking her questions when Maria Pia fell asleep and after many dissatisfying non-answers says ""I am not so blind as you and the healer seem to think""!A few days later the ""healer"" and assistant were summoned to the palazzo again, but this time Nicoletta knows that no one is ill. Maria Pia therefore went back to the Palazzo with another assistant, but this assistant is old and when asked about Nicoletta kept telling the Don how wonderful and extraordinary she really is. This gives Don Giovanni a reason to choose a bride at The Bridal Convent. His choice is Nicoletta, who gets escorted (begging and struggling) back to the palazzo by the Don.In the following days up to and after the wedding arguments heat up, a few murders commited, the staff gossip, while Nicoletta grows into the role of the Lady of the Palazzo."

The characters are now well drawn, Nicolette is weak, scared and is not consitant with her personality. We do not get to know what makes Giovanni &quot;tick&quot; he is not well drawn and what motivates him. Feehan spent so much time trying to make the castle a dark scarry place that it was overkill. Nicolette the villiage healer is picked as the bride for the local and powerful Don Giovanni,who is cursed, after she heals his neice. He persues her and seems to speak to her with special powers that scare her, even though she has her own special healing powers. Nicolette goes from being a superstitious weak scardy cat, to not caring at all and doing as she pleases. Giovanni pushes the wedding ahead, not wanting to wait to take her. He goes from extremely controlling to being very caring and gentle. Giovanni does not care that he takes her from what she loves, or what is important to Nicolette as long as she does what he tells her to do. Nicolette finally figures out that the family &quot;curse&quot; for the Scarlettis is from a family member and frees Giovanni from the curse.

Christine Feehan has put these elements in play in such exciting ways in her Dark series that she's raised the bar incredibly for Paranormal romance. It's hard to picture anyone writing about noble vampire-like creatures in a more exciting, sensuous, just flat out stunning way. This book, though not about the vampire-like beings in her others, adds an exciting Gothic twist to Christine's writing, and a clever mystery to her incredibly involving characterizations. The suspenseful ending is very exciting, and the reader is not sure until the end how the book will resolve.

Nothing, not a word about the Jaguar curse. And why do the walls and ceilings change? Ideas introduced and left at that. Ms. Feehan went, once again, off on a tagent.

The heroine is a healer but in a time where she could be burned at the stake should this secret gift be discovered. In order to protect herself, she pretends to be a healers apprentice. Unfortunately, the one man she wishes to hide this talent from, Giovanni Scarletti, is not fooled.Like much of Feehan's work, the story is very gothic in feel and the villain(s) are truly horrible. While the hero is constantly swooping in and saving the heroine, it becomes more of a joke between the two of them than a tiresome what-a-stupid-girl scenario.I was leary of this novel after being dissappointed with &quot;Lair of the Lion.&quot; This novel is much, much better.

They all violently die. One of the villagers Nicoletta knows first hand that her own mother was a victim of the curse. Still, she lives life to the fullest and uses her abilities to heal people. Her guardian helps hide the secret that Nicoletta has empathic talents by fostering the idea she is just the village healer to keep her safe from Giovanni Scarletti.However, the kind Nicoletta helps cure ailing lass, suffering from dining on a contaminated meal with her uncle Giovanni. He immediately realizes that Nicoletta is his life mate and will protect her from his enemies, but will his need to keep her safe end up making him follow the footsteps of his ancestors who loved so deep they killed for love?Though there is a political sidebar that adds suspense to the tale, this gothic story line belongs to the two lead characters. Nicoletta is the classic heroine willing to do the right thing even at the cost of her own life. Giovanni is the dark brooding alpha male wanting to also do the right thing for his people and especially his beloved. Toss on top of the key theme a bit of the paranormal and readers have Christine Feehan's intrepid venture outside the Carpathian realm (see her ""Dark"" series) into a totally different sub-genre that proves she is a versatile talent who deserves a wide readership.Harriet Klausner"

Penn ""WordWeaving""",5/5,5.0,987206400,Gothic danger and passionate love -- Very highly recommended,"The ancient dons worshipped the old gods, honoring their pagan heritage and building the palazzo in defiance of the Holy Church. Two centuries ago the Scarletti family was cursed, and now for years there have been rumors of murders and assignations. Indeed, the palazzo itself feels evil to sensitive Nicoletta, a woman who is known to be &quot;different&quot; in her gifts to heal, to listen to the wind, to sense danger. So when the mesmerizing Don Scarletti chooses her to be his bride, Nicoletta knows every bride who entered the palazzo is doomed.Nicoletta roamed the hills surrounding her village before the don's choice of her curtailed her activities to the palazzo. She had sworn no man would command her, but when she fled her home to hide, the don followed her, luring her with his own gift. The don's darkly sensual voice, erotic and seductive, entices her imagination and her womanhood, linking her to the man she would flee.Don Scarletti knows well the dangers that lurk upon his land. Political upheaval and family secrets threaten the woman he takes as wife, as well as the others dependent upon him. He carefully guards his own gifts from others than his chosen bride. Only Nicoletta can reach through his icy aloofness to the passionate man concealed within.As a new comer to Christine Feehan's work, I had very high expectations based on other reader's reactions, and I am not disappointed. Written with a sensuous style, a deep understanding for history, and a respect for both Christianity and Paganism, THE SCARLETTI CURSE contains a fast paced plot and dynamic characterizations. All the classic gothic elements keep the pages turning, including the dark castle with gargoyles, warnings from natural elements, portents from ravens, secret passageways, family secrets, and multiple dead wives. Further, the strong heroine isn't too perfect; the troubled hero still maintains his strength amid his human failings, while the gothic elements lend the perfect depth and shadow. Very highly recommended."

The plot was good, the hero and heroine were a good match, but I could not get past all the breaks in the sentences to inclue a couple of Italian words. It seemed that Ms. Feehan tried too hard to add that touch of Italian to every other sentence by putting in the two Italian words for my bother, my mother, my father, my grandfather, my grandmother. It was down right annoying to keep reading these few sets of words so frequently. It was very hard to keep the pace of reading the book when the sentences were broken up so often with the Italian. I have been a romance reading for over 20 years and have frequetnly read romance with touches of another language thrown in here and there, but this one was just to choppy for me to enjoy.

Obviously this book is part of the required reading. It is a 'standard' work by which I mean that it and a few others are considered to be baseline, required reading for anyone who wishes to advance beyond the elementary level in the field of hermeneutics.That said, I give it four stars because it is definitely not accessible by everyone. It is written for people who have a serious goal in mind and a disciplined study habit. It is not ""easy reading"" though it is well worth the effort. Further it is much more beneficial to those who have at least a working knowledge of Biblical Hebrew & Greek. In my class there are those who are entry level students (or auditors) who do not meet these criteria and I require them to read Berkhof but I augment the course with other books (""Reading the Bible With Heart & Mind"" by T. Longman, for one). This helps them advance with what they can get from Berkhof and reminds the more advanced students of their need to remain devotional in their Bible studies also.All in all, highly recommended for any reader as long as they understand what they are getting. You will be introduced to the various historical approaches to Biblical Interpretation (there are more than one you know), a sketch of a critique for each and a solid outline of how to build a more carefully crafted understanding of what the Bible teaches in your own reading."

That said, I think what is said here would be sufficient for many people to come to terms with the core principles.At the end of many of the sections in the book are a list of references to other books and a set of questions. The questions seem to be based on the other works referenced, but I haven't been able to check as I don't have access to any of the cited works. Unfortunatly, due to the age of this text, many of the cited works are not longer in print.Many of the questions later on in the book are require you to apply the techniques covered to particular verses; no answers are provided, so it'd be useful for you to have someone who you can ask to check your answers."

Then experience had become my mentor, wiping its feet on that pristine part of myself that was idealistic and analytical. It is disheartening when a thinking person is forced to admit that many cliches are true. There is no justice on this earth. Nothing would ever undo what Ronnie Joe Waddell had done."" (p. 6)Scarpetta is a the medical examiner and Waddell, recently executed inmate, is her latest case. The Waddell case won't be so easy, and it turns out his prints are showing up at crimes during and after his execution. Was the wrong person executed? Waddell's prints are in ""the system"". Speaking of systems, who broke into Scarpetta's computer? And why are her two employees, Ben and Susan, acting strangely? On top of this, Scarpetta has to ""babysit"" her sidekick and her niece. Her sidekick, Pete Marino, is a cop who can't get over the end of his marriage. With bad health habits and a sour disposition, Scarpetta has to constantly remind Marino to watch out for himself. And her niece, Lucy, has gone from being a fat little kid to a thin, super intelligent math and science whiz. Lucy is now a bratty 17- year old with a terrible attitude. But hey, she can help Scarpetta with the computer, so it's worth having Lucy around! (I think Lucy is supposed to be annoying- it makes her more realistic.)So, it appears Scarpetta has to figure out why Waddell's prints are appearing at new crimes and why other people are being murdered. Simple enough, right? Yes, but it doesn't stay simple. Cornwell makes the plot extremely hole-ridden with little sidetracks. Scarpetta's missing her lover, Mark James. She's trying to make amends with flakey morgue attendant Susan Story. Professionally, Scarpetta's in A LOT of trouble, and the government nor the media will give her space. She also has to deal with the families of the deceased, who move in and out of the story, sometimes reappearing, and sometimes disappearing into thin air. These details bog down what could be an excellent thriller.What I do like - the vivid descriptions of Virginia winters. Completely spot on, and it makes me look forward to a break in my current sticky, summer weather. :)The medical procedures are described in detail - electric chair executions, autopsies, fatal gun shot wounds, etc.Again, though, Cornwell does ""too much of a good thing"" by getting overly technical with the description of Robyn Naismith's/Sam Potter's residence. As for the mysterious feathers, again, too much detail is given to the what, where, why and how's of orinthology. Too many pages devoted to the types of feathers in down. Bo-ring!This is an average read. I am not encouraging you to run to your local bookstore, because it would be a total waste of money. When you have time, and space on your library card account, check out this book. BUT, do not make it your first Scarpetta novel, because it will turn you away from the series!"

Jin,0/0,3.0,1273795200,"Excellent first half, unfocussed and over-the-top second half","'Cruel And Unusual' won Patricia Cornwell the CWA's Gold Dagger award, suggesting that those in the know regard it as her best Scarpetta book. I'm not so sure. The first half is excellent, raising the baffling and unsettling prospect of a killer committing murders from Beyond The Grave. But I feel the book badly loses focus in the second half, resulting in a rushed and somewhat anti-climactic conclusion.Note that this book sets up a story thread through the next two books, so you must read this before tackling 'The Body Farm' and 'From Potters Field'.To the story itself: convicted murderer Ronnie Waddell has just been executed. But when a young boy is found murdered in a strikingly similar fashion, Scarpetta, Marino and Wesley are forced to consider a number of disturbing possibilites. Is there a copycat killer? Or was the wrong man sentenced to the chair? This part of the book is well written, with a strong focus on the forensic science, as well as a study of Waddell himself and the crime he allegedly committed. But when another ""copycat"" killing turns up Waddell's fingerprint, things take a very bizzare twist.Here is where the book loses me. Instead of considering more logical possibilities about how a dead man's fingerprint might have got somewhere, Scarpetta and Co jump to the most extraordinary conclusion. The idea that Waddell could (a) convince another person to go to the chair for him, and (b) organise smuggling the imposter in and himself out, is ridiculous. Also, the latter part of the book is increasingly taken up with an investigation into Scarpetta herself, dragging her into court on the flimsiest of ""evidence"". Cornwell really lets her poor-woman-persecuted-by-evil-sexist-men theme go over the top here. Arrogant oaf Patterson may be, but to pin a multiple murder on Scarpetta? It's silly.The end result is that the conclusion to the book is incredibly rushed. It literally takes place within the last few pages, and is based on little more than a sudden hunch from Scarpetta. Combined with the fact that the finale is deliberately open-ended, the whole thing comes across as a huge anti-climax. While it does provide the perfect lead-in to 'The Body Farm', as a stand-alone ending I can only remember how cheated I felt when I first read the book.So in all, a great beginning that's let down by a confused and unfocussed conclusion. The central plot is clever and the investigation is interesting, but it's disappointing Cornwell seems to lose the thread of the story badly in the second half.[3.5 stars]."

It was great to backtrack and discover what has become one of my favorite books in the series. The story is SO imaginative and original! The suspense is taut and kept me on the edge of my seat. And most of all, there is Kay, a three dimensional, refreshingly human heroine. No, she isn't perfect. As the possibility of an affair with a married man arose, I wasn't &quot;appalled&quot; by Kay, I was heartbroken for her. Driven by work, shattered by lost love, reaching for someone to bring her back to life emotionally ... her feelings may not be noble but they certainly seemed human to me. A powerful woman in a controversial, conventionally male field, and reviewers ask why so many people hate her? It seems very realistic that the head of a high-profile state agency would find herself with enemies. While I have no real criticism of this book, I do have a comment on the rest of the series. Part of why I enjoyed this one so much is Lucy. As the series progresses, Lucy's life gets so complicated and convulated and dangerous that it is her character, not Kay's, that strains credibility. It was refreshing to revisit a time when Lucy was a teenager whose biggest (immediate) problem was access to a car."

After a decade of appeals, Ronnie Joe Waddell is finally being executed and Scarpetta waits to perform the autopsy (though I'm not clear why that should be necessary). But that same evening, a young boy is ritually murdered in a manner very reminiscent of Waddell's style. That's followed by another murder -- and Waddell's fingerprints apparently are found on the scene. Was someone else executed in his place? The authorities involved, of course, don't even want to *think* about such an appalling possibility. More murders follow, including Scarpetta's own Morgue Attendant, and suddenly links seem to be turning up to tie the Chief Medical Examiner to the killings, as well as to corruption in her own office. All the action takes place in the few weeks preceding and following the Christmas-New Year's holidays, and the gray, cold winter adds greatly to the flavor of the narration.There's no question that this one is an improvement over the first one I read. Cornwell doesn't bring in a completely new character in the last chapter to be the villain, for one thing. And she has added considerable depth to the personalities of all the repeating characters, especially Lt. Pete Marino of Richmond Homicide and FBI Special Agent Benton Wesley. My favorite, though, is Lucy, Scarpetta's niece from Miami, who possesses what another character calls a &quot;frightening intellect.&quot; But she's still seventeen years old, and her home life is, in many ways, not a happy one. Aunt Kay really does try to be the friend and confident to Lucy that she would like to be, but she has her own emotional problems -- not least among them the death of her lover in an IRA bombing in London less than a year before -- and her naturally reserved and somewhat stony personality is sometimes her own worst liability.There are problems, though. Cornwell has a rather pompous style, especially when she's describing the latest crime-fighting technological advances, or the ins and outs of UNIX. It's as if she enjoys saying &quot;I know more about this than you do.&quot; She also indulges in irritating word-choices, such as not knowing the difference between &quot;in&quot; and &quot;inside&quot; (e.g., &quot;I put my revolver inside my purse&quot;), and she seems to be unaware of the use of contractions in ordinary speech. Still, the well thought out plot and the complications in possible motives and interpretations kept me reading. Many fans and reviewers take it as a given that Cornwell is the &quot;best&quot; mystery writer working, which I can't agree with at all. But she's not bad."

In that sense it was a really good read and delivered the suspense it promised. I usually enjoy Patricia's books and like the way she builds a profile of her heroine's life, including the people she is close to as well as those more on the periphery of her life - it helps the reader to relate to her and treat her as a real person. I particularly like the way she combines her professional life with her personal one and think it shows the human side which is very necessary considering her profession which could otherwise seem very detached and clinical so well done for that consideration. The plot was complex but not too much so and very cleverly thought out. The only reason I didn't find it unputdownable was because for me the over usage of technical jargon got in the way too much. Most people not familiar with the terminology will probably find it irritating - after all, who wants to have to refer to a medical directory to understand what's being said! I have heard many others make a similar comment but personally I never found it a bother in her other books but on this occasion I was quite exasperated.

At least, she thinks it's his body. On the same day of Waddell's execution, another murder occurs--this one eerily similar to the one committed nine years ago. When the killer strikes again--this time, murdering one of Scarpetta's morgue assistants--Scarpetta quickly finds herself accused of committing the crime herself. Is it a copycat killer? Or has Waddell escaped his punishment? The plot is complex, and this works both for and against the book. The story sometimes so bizarre, so complex, that the reader can't help but keep turning the pages. On the other hand, the plot is so convoluted that the reader may lose track of what's going on. Although readers may agree that everything fits together in the end, they may still be feeling a little confused. In addition to this, Cornwell throws several plot elements at the reader that take the reader completely by surprise--and not in a good way. For example, Scarpetta is in the middle of the investigation when she suddenly recalls that a significant love interest has been killed in a terrorist attack several months before the story actually begins. This is certainly news to any reader who has read this book's predecessor, All That Remains, which concludes with the love interest still very much alive. So much is happening between the books that it just doesn't seem fair to the reader, not to mention sloppiness on the author's part. Cornwell would have done better to give the love story subplot more attention in the story, since it later plays a vital role in Scarpetta's exoneration. Overall, Cruel and Unusual works as a crime novel, but still leaves the reader somewhat dissatisfied at the end."

Since he was Kay's lost/found love, I guess I would have expected more than a two paragraph explanation of what happened. I assume Kay will have a new love interest in a future book - let's just hope he fairs better than Mark did.Why did Kay move? How did she quit smoking (being an ex-smoker myself - I would be interested in reading the withdrawal symptoms of a medical examiner)? Any reconciliation attempts between Marino and his wife?How can so many people hack into Kay's files? Is it usual in an ME's position to have so many people against/after you (I don't recall Quincy having this much trouble)?The story line was good. The medical portions are morbidly interesting (that is a good thing). I miss the human element. Kay gave the reader more reaction with Abby's death from the previous novel than with the death of a man (Mark) that she has loved/hated for most of her adult life."

As such she has the nasty job of processing the remains of murderer Ronnie Waddell, electrocuted after ten years of incarceration. The next day she has another body on her hands, a young man, Eddie Heath, dumped in the street strangely mutiliated. The modus operandi of Heath's murder has some suggestive echoes of the killing for which Waddell is executed. And the plot thickens further when a middle-aged fortune-teller turns up dead in her car and a fingerprint found on her furniture is identified as one of Waddell's. Meanwhile all is not well is Dr Scarpetta's office. Someone has been mucking about with the files on her computer and her morgue supervisor, Susan Stevens, is acting very oddly...This is rather good fun, extremely readable stuff. It's the first of Cornwell's books I have read and it leaves me feeling pretty well-disposed to the prospect of reading one or two more. Scarpetta is an interesting heroine, likeable but complicated and Cornwell is an excellent plotter. If you like crime fiction and haven't tried any Cornwell before, you could do a lot worse than checking this out."

Cruel and Unusual is one of the best in the series in my opinion. I say this because Cornwell is at her best when she quietly piles on the tension factor. Cornwell at her worst is when she feels the need to multiply the body count via the worlds evilest serial killer ala James Patterson. Sadly, after 'Cruel and Unusual', Cornwell starts in on several books that just go further and further out on a limb of insanity. Happily for you the reader, if you have not read this book yet, you are in for a very entertaining yarn from Cornwells best period.The plot here is fairly complicated and its hard to describe much of it without giving away some of the earlier surprises. So I will suffice to say that it starts out when Scarpetta is called in to do an autopsy on a recently executed death row inmate. However, it quickly becomes apparent that something is not quite right. A couple of days earlier a young lad had been killed in much the same manner as the death row inmate and soon it looks like the executed man somehow might not have been the right person put to death. Instead the death row guy might be out on the street knocking off victims once again. How did this happen?Also, Scarpetta is dragged into a series of questions to answer when files start to go missing in her office and something or other is amuck.I hope you read this book. If you haven't tried Scrapetta in the past, its best to start with the first in this series, Postmordom."

The husband of the murdered woman begins spreading damaging rumors about Scarpetta and a noose of circumstantial evidence is pulled around her. Soon she is trying to solve the murders for her own self-defense as well as just doing her job. During all of this, her young niece Lucy comes to stay with her and she helps with unraveling a mystery involving computer records of fingerprints. Scarpetta is also helped by her friends Pete Marino, a homicide investigator and Benton, an old friend from the FBI.

Nelson,0/1,4.0,1133395200,Lots of loose ends.,"I really like both this author and her popular heroine Dr. Kay Scarpetta because of the maturity of the character in addition to the stoicism that is displayed by her cool and collected manner. She is the ultimate professional. This book ""Cruel and Unusual"" is not up to the author's personal standards set in other books such as ""Trace"" which is one of the very best she has written to date.I have spent the past 10 minutes rereading parts of this book and am still confused by the mishmash ending. I don't have a real clue what happened to the bad guys here. Where is the ravening beast convict who was released from prison and resulted in a number of unsolved murders as one example? There is a lot of personal stuff to soften and ""humanize"" the image of Dr. Scarpetta, but even with the snarky neice Lucy with her smart alecky mouth, there is still the steely and distant feel to Dr. Scarpetta. I like that a lot.IMO, the absolute worst thing an author can do to a strong female character is to make her suddenly get ""melting bones"" or those insipid hormonal storms, a la the Nora Roberts style, et al, that stimulate their ""broody"" instincts at the first sight of an acceptable male and the next topic becomes gooey babies and sucky conversations with relatives rather than science and focus and dedication to one's career that makes for a tight, fascinating and worthwhile read.So, with that in mind, this book gets a 4 pointer simply because Ms. Cornwell avoids the ""romance-crime drama"" pitfalls and forges ahead with a decent, albeit patchy and vague story. I am glad that the author has also forged ahead in her craft and her subsequent stories are sooooo much better than this one."

Then, after the death of her assistant, Susan Story, Kay becomes implicated in the crime. Can she discover the true killer before she ends up either in jail or dead herself?What I Liked:First off, I enjoyed Cornwell's writing style. She writes with intelligence and detail, brining you into the very scene. The autopsies, the attention to detail (particularly in relation to Eddie and Jennifer), the thorough regard for the scenery all made it very easy to transport myself to Virginia with Dr. Scarpetta.Further, the story was pretty interesting and left you guessing. When I opened the book, I would have had no clue of the outcome, which was surprising (if, in a sense, a little disappointing as well). Several seemingly unrelated people die, but somehow Cornwall is able to tie their deaths in at the very end.My favorite characters included Benton Wesley, Marino, and, of course, Kay. Benton was an intelligent man, kind and someone Kay could turn to. But he almost held an aristocratic air. Marino, on the other hand, was more down to earth. I enjoyed his arguing with Lucy and how the gruff man ended up coming to Christmas to Kay's after all. Finally, I grew fond of Kay. At first, I found her hard to approach, but then I realized that was her personality anyway. As the story progressed, I felt I got more of a handle on who she was and what she wanted. Further, I enjoyed how she paid attention to detail and thought things through logically.What I Did Not Like:Now, this could be due to my taking a month longer than I should have to finish this book, but I felt the story was slow (but not in an obvious ""Will this book ever end?"" fashion). I was plugging along and realized, ""Hm, I'm halfway through and still have no clue how the heck this is going to end"". This is not necessarily bad, but I would certainly not classify this book as one of those racing thrillers that keeps you on the edge of your seat every moment.My biggest complaint has to be the character of Lucy. She is probably the most annoying character in the book. Her selfish, bratty whining made me wish frequently she would go home. Her actual purpose in the book was so small, I have no idea why she was included for most of it! All she did was discover the message left in Kay's computer and that AFIS had been corrupted. I felt that Cornwall was repetitively shoving Lucy away because she was in the way (sending her to ski with Benton's wife, having her left home alone while Kay ran around doing errands, etc.). And I have a hard time believing that a 17 year old could be such a computer brainiac. I think the story would have been much better without her.Lastly, I felt the ending was rather rushed, the story concluding rather hastily in the last 10 pages or so, almost as if Cornwall was being pushed to get the story done and hurriedly threw the last bits together.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:Dialogue is relatively tame, considering the genre. A few d***, h***, ba*****, and some wandering appearances of the f-word.Lucy complains about her mother's promiscuity and asks Kay if her aunt will have an affair. Kay's lover is brought up. Marino goes home with a woman after a Christmas party.Finally, three people are killed in the course of this book (well, more if you count Waddell, the death row criminal, and his victim). The autopsies describe the injuries, which can make the squeamish squeam. Also an explosion is described in retrospect.Overall:My first thought at finishing this is ""Ho-hum"". ""Cruel and Unusual"" is not really a bad book. It is well written and fairly interesting. I just felt that parts drug more than they should and really couldn't stand certain nameless (LUCY!) characters. 3 stars.Brought to you by*C.S. Light*"

The book is a must-read for those addicted to Cornwell's well-researched suspense novels, since it sets the stage for a showdown in From Potter's Field. But a major plot hole revealed in the first few pages leaves the reader feeling cheated for the remainder of the novel.We enter the story with Scarpetta recovering from the death of a close friend. While this development certainly bodes well for future plot twists, it leaves the reader frustrated with the current one. The few details of the death surface mostly at the end of the story and while we're told of Scarpetta's devastation, we really don't witness it. Seasoned Cornwell fans are accustomed to these shallow depths in characterization but it nonetheless puts a damper on an otherwise entertaining mystery."

I have loved all the Scarpetta's, and read them at least twice over, and i still think this is the worst.The plot was very complicated, and it all seemed a bit of a mess. The characters were nothing special, and i this is the only book in which Cornwell manage to bore me with her normally insightful computer terminology. It's too long, and basically i dont think it has any substance. There is a great potential. The idea for the plot is superb, and could well have been one of the best, but somewhere along the line it all slips. I cant put my finger on it, but i just didnt come away from this with the satisfaction i normally get out of a Kay Scarpetta book.Nevertheless this is still a necessary book to read if you intend to read the entire series. It is one of the major turning points. The first book to feature Temple Gault, who would later lead to Carrie Grethen, Newton Joyce, and all the other catastrophic events which culminate in the next turning point of &quot;The Last Precint&quot;. each one has signalled a new era for Patricia Cornwell, and each one has not been quite as good as the others. But The Last Precint was still much better than this. It is, admittedly, very clever, but far too complicated, and im surprised it got the CWA's gold dagger.nevertheless, i have given it two stars purely because it is such a major point in Scarpetta's life.

A death row inmate, Waddle, is executed, but before his body is even cool, murdered corpses start piling up with Waddle's fingerprints found at the scene of the crime. Next thing you know, people are dropping like flies, some of them close to Dr. Kay, and she is publicly implicated in the deaths.Cornwell has written a workably entertaining mystery here. The plot is engaging and bubbling with intrigue, and the writing isn't hampered by too much extraneous detail or incidental goings-ons. There is a subplot with Kay's niece, Lucy, that I found a tad ingratiating and annoying, but for anyone reading the Scarpetta mysteries in order, it is an understandable and rather necessary bit of character development.I do, however, object to Cornwell relegating some of the more serious character development to the back story. I'm talking about the sudden death of Kay's long-time love interest, Mark, (and, to a lesser extent, her decision to quit smoking). These are pretty significant events in Kay's life, and to leave them in the background as part of the story dressing seems at odds with an author who wants us to sympathize with her character.To that end, some of the story ended up either ringing false to me, or just falling flat. For example, there is much made of Kay's financial secrets, which she refers to in connection with embarassment and rage. When the secrets are finally revealed, I found them to be maudlin and a little silly. It baffled me why Kay would take such pains to keep them hidden.Furthermore, I respect Cornwell's decision to keep her novels secured solely in the Holmesian realm of mystery solving, but this means that there is very little action in the book, and a lot of key details are discussed and reviewed over and over again by the characters. It makes for repetitive reading. It also means that the actual discovery of the culprit's identity is never as important as the sleuthing that went into discovering that identity.In other words, if you're looking for closure with this story, you won't get much. Cornwell does a great job of setting up quite a puzzler, and it will keep you guessing. But, much like a magician with an amazing magic trick, once you learn the secret, you're bound to be a little disappointed."

This is my fifth Patricia Cornwell book, but definitely is not my favorite. The plot was terrific--the idea of a death row inmate possibly escaping from prison is a frightening concept, especially since Cornwell is always right on the ball when it comes to accuracy of details. As always, the characters are so realistic that the reader often must test himself to remember that they are indeed fictional. This book got a five star rating from me until about halfway when political injustices against the main character intervened. Although this was a good idea for a plot twist, it seemed that Cornwell was digressing from the main idea of the story, taking the reader into another story completely separate from what we read in the beginning. The ending was a disappointment--throughout the story, Cornwell is setting the reader up for the usual great climax where the perpetrator is discovered and captured and all is well--and then, it doesn't happen. In my opinion, it seemed like the ending was written by not Cornwell, but another author who rushed to complete this chapter of Kay Scarpetta's adventures as soon as possible. Overall, Cruel and Unusual was a good book that unfortunately could have been a great book if the right elements had been present."

The writing itself is good. The main character Kay Scarpetta and an old professor of hers are well `fleshed out'.The bad: Other characters are not well `fleshed out'. The plot never fully explains itself. Is the book about figuring out how a dead criminal could commit crimes - or is it about Scarpetta - redeeming herself in the eyes of everyone around her - after developing an anti-social workaholic tendency after the death of a loved one? The latter seems to be the path the author choose - leaving some of the twist in the plot unresolved. Though others in the story have made Scarpetta out to be the villain (on many different levels - as a family member, as a friend and as a professional) in the end her `goodness' is redeemed. How the bad guys in the story turn out seems to be unimportant - which I found to be a major flaw."

An executed inmate's fingerprints turn up at another crime scene. How could this possibly happen? Perhaps he's still alive, having been switched with another inmate instead of dying himself.

What passed for character development was more like being beat over the head with a ten-pound hammer: we know that Kay is cold and detached, that Lucy needs to be loved, and so on. I knew it the first time Cornwell told me. To tell -- not show -- me again and again, always in the same exact way, the same conversations, made me roll my eyes with boredom. Plus, the characters were so one-dimensional, I just didn't care.Ultimately, though, you read a mystery novel for the mystery, and I just didn't find it that interesting. The killer was boring and came out of the blue, the twists not particularly interesting, and the villains, such as they were, not particularly villainous.All in all, a decent read but not much more.

I have read two others (Cause of Death and Black Notice) before this one, but this is my favorite of the three. Cruel and Unusual contains elements found in the other Scarpetta novels (difficult conversations with her mother and sister, major neuroses revolving around her niece, Lucy, internal plots hatched to ruin Scarpetta, and expecting Pete Marino to drop dead from his excesses at any second), but not to the point where I found the repetition annoying. If anything, I want to see more of these familiar characters. The autopsy details seemed less excessive and the pace was quicker.Cruel and Unusual begins with the execution of a rapist/murderer, and the following autopsy of the felon. Shortly thereafter, a string of seemingly unconnected murders erupt around Richmond. Scarpetta finds one common strand - all appear to be committed by the supposedly dead convict. As if this isn't bad enough, her assistant is murdered and the press indicts Scarpetta.As always, Cornwell's knowledge of forensic medicine and the law were put to good use.

950,B000890HE2,Gaston de Blondeville (The modern novelists),,AVRVACFKJ5QMM,"Tyler R. Tichelaar ""Tyler R. Tichelaar, Ph.D....",12/12,5.0,1184112000,Mrs. Radcliffe: First Lady of Historical Fiction,"Valancourt Books' recent publication of Mrs. Radcliffe's Gaston de Blondeville is a publication long overdue. The novel, originally published in 1826, three years after the mistress of the Gothic's death, was actually written by her in 1803, but then suppressed by her from publication. The general belief is that she disowned the novel, thinking it inferior to her other work; literary historians have also claimed that readers agreed and greeted its publication with little enthusiasm. The primary reason usually given for why it is inferior is that it is the only one of Radcliffe's Gothic novels where she chose to use a real ghost rather than explain what appeared to be supernatural occurrences. The general reader, and especially the student of Gothic and historical fiction, should be allowed to judge the matter for himself and now that Valancourt Books has republished Gaston de Blondeville, that decision can be made.Gaston de Blondeville, while admittedly not as full of chills and suspense as The Mysteries of Udolpho or The Italian, is a remarkable novel in Radcliffe's canon. It marks a noted departure from her earlier novels, and in many ways, it displays her growth and restraint as an author. Considering all her previous novels were published between the time she was twenty-five and thirty-three, a remarkably young age for someone to write three of the greatest Gothic novels of all time, as well as a couple inferior ones, it is not surprising that Radcliffe sought to move in a new direction in her work. Gaston de Blondeville was the beginning of her growth in that new direction, and had she written another like it, readers may have had a real treat in an even greater Radcliffe.My only criticism of Valancourt Books' edition of Gaston de Blondeville--which is filled with a superb collection of secondary sources and an impressive scholarly introduction by Frances Chiu to reflect the historical and political influences of the French Revolution upon the novel--is that no attempt is made in these supplementary materials to explain why Radcliffe made this departure from her past use of rational explanations for supposed supernatural occurrences. I believe that departure is the big question that must be answered about this novel, especially since Radcliffe was otherwise striving to be more realistic from a historical standpoint.Despite what is typically said about Gaston de Blondeville by literary historians, the six contemporary reviews provided in this edition are largely favorable. In her introduction, Frances Chiu quotes these reviews to argue that literary critics condemned the novel, but in truth, only one review is solidly negative while the rest express great enthusiasm for a new work by Mrs. Radcliffe. Chiu quotes La Belle Assemblee as saying ""it is without the lofty pretensions of some of Mrs. Radcliffe's earlier productions, and incapable of exciting an equal intenseness of interest"" but Chiu fails to quote what comes directly after: ""it will not in the slightest degree detract from the fame of her"" and ""it will be read with great satisfaction by every reader of taste."" Scots Magazine was pleased that the novel does not include so much of her poetry which is not remarkable at all, and overall feels the novel is an improvement on her earlier work because ""She avoided long particulars of rural scenery, and tedious trackings of the agitated mind, from one terrible or sorrowful imagination to another."" In fact, the only review that is truly negative is the Monthly Review, which does find parts of the work to praise but chiefly objects to its use of the supernatural.Why Radcliffe decided to include supernatural events as a reality has not been given a good explanation. Perhaps she felt the supernatural was more acceptable to the reading public by the earlier nineteenth century, nearly fifteen years after she wrote her first Gothic novel. While she may have been in competition with other Gothic writers, her contemporaries, such as Matthew Lewis in The Monk (1795) and William Godwin in St. Leon (1799), were not beyond using the supernatural as a possibility, so perhaps she need no longer provide rational explanations for supernatural events. Greater study is needed of how the view toward the supernatural changed and became acceptable in literature, especially during this period as the ""Age of Reason"" was replaced by the horrors of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars.What I find more remarkable about Gaston de Blondeville than Radcliffe's use of the supernatural is that it is one of the earliest historical fiction novels. Sir Walter Scott is often credited with being the first major writer of historical fiction, but historical fiction certainly has its roots in Gothic novels with their typically medieval settings. The difference between Gothic and historical fiction is the concentration on a much more realistic historical world. The Gothic typically sets its novels in a more vaguely historical period or avoids attention to historic detail. A key component to historical fiction is the depiction of historical events and historical personages in the background of the novel, such as the Battle of Culloden as the background to Scott's Waverley (1814). If that is true, then I would argue that Radcliffe is our first true female historical novelist since Gaston de Blondeville, although not published until 1826, was written in 1803, a full six years before Jane Porter's The Scottish Chiefs (1809), that tremendous novel about Sir William Wallace, and only three years after Godwin's St. Leon (1799) which only really attains historical fiction status due to its including the historical character of Bethlem Gabor in its pages. (Arguments have been made that Clara Reeve is the first female writer of historical fiction, but I don't feel her work is historically detailed enough to merit such a claim). Radcliffe is far more historically detailed than Godwin in her descriptions of the court of Henry III and in the details she provides of that age of chivalry, tournaments, and medieval monasteries. While her novel may not have had the influence on historical fiction that Scott's works did, and therefore, she may not be the mother of historical fiction, not having led to the birth of similar historical works, as she was for Gothic novels, she certainly is the aunt, who has been kept like a skeleton in the closet, while Gaston de Blondeville has been treated as if it were better not to be talked about it, lest it ruin the Mistress of Gothic Literature's good name.I encourage all lovers of Gothic and historical fiction to read Gaston de Blondeville to make up their own minds. I personally find the novel a much more concise, controlled and mature work, and if not as fascinating and suspenseful as her previous works, one that deserves further attention. If Mrs. Radcliffe had written and published a couple more historical novels after Gaston de Blondeville, I have no doubt she would have rivaled Sir Walter Scott for his dominant place as a writer of historical fiction. As always, I commend Valancourt Books for preserving our literary heritage by printing such important and overlooked works of literature.- Tyler R.

Festivities abound, wine flows copiously, and spirits are high as the King and his subjects prepare to celebrate the nuptials of Sir Gaston de Blondeville. But the joyous mood is interrupted when a merchant, Hugh Woodreeve, comes distraught before the King to demand justice. His kinsman, he claims, was murdered, by the very man the King has come to honour -- Gaston de Blondeville!Suspecting a conspiracy against Gaston, yet obliged to hold a trial to determine the truth of the allegations, Henry imprisons Woodreeve in a tower while awaiting a hearing. Meanwhile, sinister forces are at work, represented by an evil abbot, who will stop at nothing to ensure the truth behind Woodreeve's claims is never revealed.As the trial unfolds and the danger mounts for both Woodreeve and Gaston, a mysterious figure will come from beyond the grave to elucidate the horrible mystery!The only one of Radcliffe's novels to feature a real ghost, Gaston de Blondeville was published posthumously in 1826. This edition, the first-ever scholarly edition of the novel, features a new introduction by Frances Chiu, uncoding the novel's long-hidden political, historical, and religious contexts. A wealth of supplementary materials, including excerpts from other primary texts and the complete text of contemporary reviews, is also provided to enhance modern readers' understanding of the novel's themes."

However, the tale goes much further than exploring the cat's desire to anthropomorphise. It deals with father-daughter relationships, love, obedience, the stiffling influence of tradition, clashes between cultures, etc. It is uniquely influenced by Jewish theological exegesis and rabbinical commentary. Moreso than Will Eisner's work which was a landmark in this area (also on Amazon).I liked the artwork in the main. Panels are loosely framed on the pages which gives a light flow to the narrative. Colours are strong and mediterranean when needs be. I have two reservations however. Firstly, some of the pieces are overdrawn. Too much unnecessary detail in a scene. Text in the speech bubbles is squeezed at times and as a middle aged person with spectacles I found it hard to read on occasion. My reading wuld have been easier if overall frame size was bigger. Secondly, and this is my major reservation, the whole tale is told primarily through language used by the characters rather than through the characters actions. In other words as a graphic novel, I thought it was too wordy. You may well observe, that it is ironic that a graphic novel based around the culture of the 'people of the Book' repeats the textual propensity of much Jewish self-commentary. Eisner, to my mind, has the text-visual balance better defined. However, these are personal aesthetic opinions and shouldn't detract from the overall conceptual achievement which is exemplary."

IThe cat in this book gains the power of speech by eating & swallowing the family's pet parrot. The cat ends up having theological & philosophical discussions with the Rabbi. The cat wants to study Kabbalah & get Bar Mitzvahed. They debate both Western thought & Jewish thought.Through the cat's eyes we listen in on the discussions of the Rabbi's students. We learn who are studious & who are vain, arrogant & self-important. We see the Rabbi turn to his own Master with his problems; but, through the cat's eyes we see this Master as less knowledgeable than his disciple. We see a Master who spouts foolishness because he knows of his own inferiority.We learn of the anti-Semitism faced by Jews in Algeria from the non-Jewish French settlers. Many of the Jews had been living in Algeria for centuries & had adopted Arab dress, food & customs. These Jews were turned away from French restaurants & other establishments. They usually felt more at home with the native Algerians; yet, always faced an undercurrent of nonacceptance. Even the French-Jewish establishment, centered in Paris, forced the leaders & Rabbis of the Algerian Jewish community to adapt to French ways, customs & speech. If such leaders & Rabbis couldn't pass demeaning grade school exams showing proficiency in French, they would be replaced; even though all native Algerian Jews spoke Hebrew & Arabic which had enabled them to get along quite well for those previous centuries.Through the cat's eyes we see the title Rabbi's struggle for acceptance by the French Jewish establishment. He is a great man in Algeria & is being considered for the post of Chief Rabbi. First he must pass this silly grade school exam. Readers see his agony & self-doubt. We see his complete joy at passing the exam & his own humbleness.We see friendship between himself & his Arab friends. We learn about Algerian Jews who have gone totally native, living like Nomadic warriors in the desert; at home with guns, knives & lions. We learn about the differences between Algerian Jews & French Jews in the pre-WWII period. We learn about street performers & Algerian Jews who must masquerade asArabs to make a living in France; as the French know almost nothing about Jews from Algeria who live like Arabs but are Jews.It's a wonderful book. There is much to learn about love, loyalty, marriage, family, hypocrisy, bravery, humbleness, friendship, loss, merriment, true riches, anti-Semitism and more. All of this is contained within less than 150 pages of a graphic novel, or what the French call, an adult comic book."

I've never seen a book that so honestly discusses an insider's ambivalence about his culture, and from such an unusual perspective. Through the eyes of the Rabbi's cat, this graphic novel relates the story of a Rabbi in 1930s Algeria and France. The Rabbi faces many challenges in navigating his 3,500 year old faith and tradition as the modern world encroaches. He has spent much of his life studying the holy books and commentaries, which provide answers to many questions from cosmic theology to everyday existence. However, he continually encounters situations his religious education did not prepare him for--from his (talking) cat's unorthodox ideas about Judaism; to his cat's desire, unprecedented for an animal, to join the Jewish tribe; to a place the Rabbi visits that does not accommodate the pious Jewish way of life. In the end, the Rabbi faces these dilemmas and difficulties with a mind of his own, in contrast to other characters who either capitulate to secularism or withdraw into hard-line and often damaging religiosity. One of the book's themes is that love and dedication, whether to other people or even to a tradition as legalistic as Judaism's, may not always mean strict obedience. In this, the cat, who is willing to dare ""sacrilegious magic"" to try and help his beloved master, is a most compelling narrator. The cat watches with a sympathetic eye as the humans around him live, struggle and at times bend the rules.Although the prose contains many gems, Sfar's drawings leave something to be desired. In particular, the cat pictures mostly fail to capture a real feline's taciturn dignity, otherwordly softness and glowing-eyed, nocturnal mystique. The human facial expressions and body language, however, add subtleties that could not be achieved in other genres. The colorist, Brigitte Findakly, more than compensates for Sfar's shortcomings as an artist. With a bright, earthy palette, Findakly adds flavor to Sfar's Algeria and France, creating an inviting world for the reader to step into. Occasional profanity, sexual scenes and complicated themes may make _The Rabbi's Cat_ unsuitable for some young children; older children and adults should definitely read this fascinating and compelling book!Familiarity with Jewish theology, law and culture will enhance one's appreciation and understanding of _The Rabbi's Cat_. For a background in the book's cultural context, the curious may want to read _Judaism for Dummies_ or its counterparts in the _Idiot's Guide_ series; in addition, _Jews, God and History_ by Max I. Dimont is my favorite overview of Jewish history and would provide an excellent introduction to the historical context of _The Rabbi's Cat_. _Jews, God and History_ reveals that even before modern times, Judaism was almost never static--to the contrary, and like most healthy traditions, it has continually evolved and developed many historical branches as it adapted to its ever changing environment. Sadly, Jews were expelled from most Arab countries as the region's antisemitism increased in the mid-20th century; however, a world that approximates the Rabbi's might still exist in some Sephardic Jewish Modern Orthodox communities that maintain their traditions while accommodating secular culture. Chabad Lubavitch, a branch of basically traditional Judaism that originated in Eastern Europe, is a bit different but is much more open to answering questions and meeting with outsiders, complete with worldwide ""Chabad houses"" for the purpose. A moderate Judaism like the Rabbi's and an irreverent Judaism like his cat's can be found in the more progressive Conservative, Masorti, Reform, Reconstructionist and UK Liberal movements."

We can be found in the unlikeliest of places; Cuba, Mexico City, Rio, Mumbai, Dublin (I'm not joking, there are Jews in Ireland).I once boarded with a Jewish family in Strasbourg. Their lives were much different from those of New York Jews; they kept a lower profile, avoided gentiles, and their eating habits were more like those of their neighbors (no bagels, herring, or kugel on their table). British Jews, respectively, make a greater effort to appear ""English"" while avoiding non-Jews.

This will make more sense after you've finished the book.One does not have to be Jewish or a scholar to appreciate the story and humor, but we gave a copy to our Rabbi as a gift and he loved it too.

The cat is one of the most charming, insightful, and funny characters to appear since Philip Roth's more audacious characters. This book is both laugh-out-loud funny, sad, sardonic, and ultimately life-affirming. It is an extremely offbeat book - trying to describe it is almost impossible. You really have to see it to ""get"" it. Unfortunately, no preview pages appear on the site, because that would greatly help to convey the character of the book.To give you an idea: in the first section, the cat eats a parrot and gains the power of speech. He explores all of the things one can do with that: taunt, lie, blaspheme, and bait. The rabbi wants to teach him Torah, but he wants to learn Kabalah. The issue is brought to ""the rabbi's rabbi,"" where the cat informs him that:""I want to convert to Judaism. He asks me why.I tell him that if I am a good Jew, the rabbi will let me spend time with his daughter.I explain to him that the rabbi's daughter is my mistress.That I can't live without her, because she is my joy, and love is a beautiful thing.He tells me that my motives for converting to Judaism are unsatisfactory, that my love of God isn't sincere.I never said anything about love of God....He says that thinking of God fills even the grayest days with sunlight. He says that the love of God should be almost carnal. He tells me that it is an intellectual love but you should always feel as though you were cradled in the arms of a master who is invincible, benevolent, and just.I tell him that this is exactly what I feel for my mistress. ...I answer that he blasphemes, that my mistress is true.He says that only God is true.I say that God is a reassuring myth. I say that he doesn't have anyone to take care of him because he is old and his parents are dead.I say that I have my mistress and I will never be alone because I will die before she does. He throws my master and me out.""Couple dialog like this with the wonderful drawings, the cat's flashing green naughty eyes, the gentle rabbi and his beloved daughter, and you have an amazingly odd, touching, and engaging book.Be advised: this is not a children's book (although if you are liberal with your older children and don't mind them dealing with some adult themes, I'm sure a lot would love it). The themes are theology, faith, death, existential fear, love, religion versus secularity, jealousy, and even class differences in France. Don't be put off though; it's an easy, fun, and quick read. Sfar is immensely talented, and the sparse prose has been carefully thought out and apparently translates well. Don't miss this one!"

When the cat eats a parrot, he gains the power of speech, only to lose it when he wants to break one of the ten commandments.There is a lot of religious details the author has provided, but for some reason he left out one rabbinic tradition, that of a wife cutting her hair when she marries.Another theme is the role ignorance of Kabbalah and Talmud play in religious circles.In summary, this book is a wonderful tale, but not meant for kids, due to some of the translated language."

They usually give me headaches, but this one revealed a quirky style and a refreshing lack of onomatopoeia in starbursts. It's so much easier to tell a good story when you're not constantly being interrupted by POW!! and ZOK!!! and the like.As a cat owner, I confess that it was the title that grabbed my attention, but I'm guessing that the plurality of cat lovers will not like the way the cat is drawn: Sfar's style sometimes reminds me a bit of Ralph Steadman's, and the cat's proportions change according to his mood and the context of the scene. Sfar focuses on intriguing details--a character might be drawn very sketchily in one scene, but some small object in the background will be meticulously rendered. In the next scene, the same character will fill the frame and be drawn with equal attention. This style works out perfectly for as mutable a creature as a cat.Format and style aside, the story is what really made me buy this book. The prose works just as it should with the illustrations, an aspect that I think some graphic novelists overwork, or ignore. As a fan of Issac Bashevis Singer, I was sucked in when the rabbi's initial response to his talking cat was ""Will he be a Jew?"" And, more importantly, ""Will he be a good Jew?"" (Not being Jewish, by the way, has not been an obstacle to enjoying the work of either author.)The book is divided into three separate stories, and while the first was my favorite, I also enjoyed following the cat and his rabbi as their family circle expanded to include an exotic friend with a lion (who gets along amiably with the cat) and a down-on-his-luck singer who has been reduced to belting out bawdy numbers on Sabbat.Like the very popular ""Persepolis"", this book has shown that graphic novels can be both funny and deep, and that they deserve to share shelves with the best non-graphic novels of our time."

What makes this graphic novel really great is the way that Sfar is able to weave very subtle everyday elements of life into his stories. The characters' emotions, particularly the rabbi and the cat have such great range and believeablity... many Western comics artists should take note.Indeed, its a welcome break from the white-boy 'slice of life' comics that are so trendy in comics now. The Rabbi even has a debate with his cat over Western-vs.Eastern thought (albiet regarding religion and philosophy). Its a much needed return to rich storytelling in comics."

The cat gains the ability to speak by swallowing the family parrot, an act that he, of course, immediately denies. The conversations between the cat, the rabbi, and the ""rabbi's rabbi"" are some of the funniest parts of the book, but along with such questions as whether the cat should be considered Jewish or whether his age (for bar mitzvah purposes) should be calculated in human or ""cat"" years, is some serious and wide-ranging philosophical and theological discussion. What is a Jew? What does it mean to be created ""in God's image""? What is the difference between the cat's feeling for his mistress and the love of God? As a Reconstructionist I like the idea put forward by another reviewer of this being ""the first Reconstructionist cat."" And what other branch of Judaism would a cat choose?Eventually the cat pronounces the sacred name of God and loses his ability to speak, and from this point the book concentrates more on the relationships between human beings, although still from the cat's perspective. He experiences the pangs of jealousy when a young rabbi from an assimilated French family comes to their town and falls in love with his young mistress . He and his master then travel with the young couple to Paris to meet the groom's family, and must adjust to a very different kind of Jewish life before they return home to Algeria. On their journey they encounter several delightful minor characters, from the rabbi's cousin Malkah of the Lions (and his pet lion) to a cabaret singer in Paris.The Rabbi's Cat can be read on several different levels - as an entertaining ""talking animal"" story, an affectionate portrait of Sephardic Jewish culture, or a complicated story of human (and animal-human) relationships.

American readers will certainly connect to the tale as an Algerian parallel to the intellectual journey of Mordecai Kaplan, the American Jewish thinker whose Judaism as a Civilization was penned at the same time of the setting of this fictional fable. Safr raises the ultimate post-Enlightenment question: What is the role of religion in the absence of a supernatual God who acts in history?

""The Rabbi's Cat"" is a graphic novel set in Algeria in the mid 1930s. A poor rabbi lives with his lovely daughter Zlabya and their precocious gray cat. In over 850 marvelously-varied panels, author Joann Sfar tells the story of the trio as they deal with the cosmic questions of life, love, God's existence and fickle human nature. The story shuttles between sun-baked traditional North Africa and rain-drenched, cosmopolitan Paris. Sfar's palette ranges from the reds, oranges and yellows of the rabbi's home country to the muted blues, greens and whites of the Moroccan night and of the Parisian day.The book's characters are wonderful and complex. The old rabbi is kind, God-fearing and gentle, but fears being replaced by a more urban man who speaks French. His beautiful, young daughter, content to remain in her father's house, playing the piano and reading, also longs for love. The cat -- a cunning and shameless atheistic and opportunist -- gains speech, insists on being Bar Mitzvah and demands to learn the Kabala. He contends pointedly, if ignorantly, with the learned over theological questions -- all the while angling for a night on the prowl. There's also old and sinewy Malka of the Lions, striding manfully from the desert, toting an ancient rifle and accompanied by his faithful leonine companion. The book follows the characters through normal life events -- shopping, praying for the dead, washing dishes -- but touches on themes of death, hypocrisy, apostasy and man's relationship with a rather enigmatic and silent God. Using this humble cast, and in a medium not fully taken seriously by all, Sfar plumbs depths not normally plumbed by many serious works. Sfar's art is deceptively spare, but is always evocative and never dull. His message is one of optimism, delivered with humor and humanity.If this book were a film, I would rate it PG-13 for a small amount of nudity and vulgarity, and for the adult themes it explores."

Ross,8/13,3.0,1177891200,Too Aimless for My Taste,"I've long been a fan of the graphic novel, and I picked this one up mainly on the strength of its Algerian setting. Parents should take note: despite its somewhat children's bookish cover and title, this book is definitely intended for an older audience (there are some four-letter words and nudity), and the somewhat rambling narrative may well not hold the attention of teens.The story starts in colonial Algiers sometime in the 1930s, where we meet a humble widowed Algerian rabbi, his beautiful daughter, and their scrawny cat. The first third of the book concerns itself mainly with the rabbi and the cat, who, after eating a parrot, gains the ability to speak. Before long, the cat wants to learn about Judaism and convert, and starts asking all kinds of thorny theological questions. This leads to a pretty funny debate with the rabbi's mentor -- all of does a nice job of capturing the disputative nature of Judaism. (Those with a background in Judaism may well get a lot more richness and texture from this storyline than non-Jews like me.)This promising storyline is abandoned when the cat loses its power of speech, and the middle section segues into a somewhat meandering account of the rabbi's need to pass a French test in order to remain rabbi and a visit by the rabbi's dashing rural cousin. While this does a reasonable job of depicting the indignities of colonialism, there's not much else to this section. The arrival of a thoroughly urbane young rabbi from Paris propels the final third, as the beautiful daughter falls in love with, and marries him. The married couple and Algerian rabbi then visit the husband's family in Paris (with the cat tagging along). There, the rabbi has trouble coping with the cultural differences, and goes on a little adventure to track down a musician nephew, leading to even further indignities.I can't say I found the book nearly as delightful as most others seem to. Despite the running theme of faith, the narrative is altogether too disjointed to my taste, and despite bursts of jollity, the entire tone seemed rather wistful. The artwork is similarly impressionistic, with forms ranging from realistic to exaggerated to surreal. The palate is quite nice, as the natural earth tones of Algeria contrast vividly with the oppressive dreary grays and blacks of Paris. At times the panels get a little crowded by text though, and the entire book is a bit 'wordier"" than your average graphic novel"

But this isn't just some loveable cat regaling us with home-spun, and potentially Torah-based wisdom. No, this cat uses bad language, is obsessed with masturbation and, on occasion, likes to grab the nearest lady cat and ""show"" her (and us, unfortunately) a thing or two. (Anyone for cat pornography?) Oh, and the lovable rabbi ends up desecrating Shabbos (the Sabbath) and eating trefe (non-kosher) food in a crisis of faith brought on by finding out that his daughter's new husband is not strictly observant and his family is not at all observant.

The tale seems promising at first, until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws. The cat represents the glorification of sin itself, and delights whenever the book's characters fall into ungodly habits, judging them forever as hypocrites (taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin). As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God. At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi, thus giving the tale a 'happy ending'. In short, 'The Rabbi's Cat' is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists, atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their self-serving, do as you feel, lifestyles.One more note: This book, despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover, is definitely not appropriate for children."

He told her that LBJ's Secret Service people instructed the motorcycle cops at the Dallas airport that these changes were being made: (a) the parade route was being changed to cut through Dealey Plaza on Elm Street; (b) the motorcycle cops would not be at the front of the presidential limousine as they normally would have been, but would only be at the rear of the presidential limousine; (c) the order of the cars in the motorcade was changed so that Johnson's car would not be immediately behind the presidential car, but that a carload of Secret Service would be in between the President's car and LBJ's car. Most shocking of all, was his report to Jean Hill that another motorcycle cop witnessed that LBJ started ducking down in his car at least 30 to 40 seconds before the first shots were fired.4. Arlen Specter, who questioned her in Dallas for the Warren Commission, was the one who proposed the &quot;single bullet theory&quot; that was adopted by the Warren Commission. His butchered transcript of her testimony to the Warren Commission was &quot;heavily edited, completely distorted and shamelessly fabricated.&quot;Author Bill Sloan does a credible job of telling Jean Hill's story and explaining her inner turmoil and emotional trauma about being a witness to the assassination. He explains about:1. Why she refused to go to Washington to testify before the Warren Commission.2. That she was romantically involved with a married man at the time (J.B. Marshall) and how he repeatedly tried to convince her to keep quiet about what she knew, and how he evidently knew more than he wanted to tell her.3. That the FBI kept her home under surveillance for 15 months after the assassination.4. Why she would not testify in the trial of Clay Shaw in New Orleans, although J.B. Marshall and Mary Moorman did.5. Her eventual vindication and validation through experiences with Bill Marrs (author of Crossfire) who introduced her to others who witnessed the assassination, and her experiences with Oliver Stone and Kevin Cossner during the filming of the movie &quot;JFK.&quot;6. The details of the attempts on her life (most significantly, one almost-fatal car wreck caused by the steering-wheel bolts being unscrewed and another time when her car's brake-fluid line was found to be cut).The most inexplicable fact about Jean Hill's story is why was Jack Ruby running at break-neck speed towards the shooter behind the fence on the grassy knoll? She did not know who Jack Ruby was until she saw him on tv, as he shot Oswald. Her fear that no one would believe her about seeing Ruby running towards one of the shooters was increased when she was told by FBI agent Shanklin that eye witnesses had proved that Ruby was not at Dealey Plaza at the time of the assassination. Perhaps her identification of Ruby at Dealey Plaza is the clue to why her testimony was distorted by the Warren Commission, why she was intimidated and humiliated, and why her story is so important. No doubt, historians, researchers, and future generations interested in finding out the truth about the JFK assassination will be grateful that Jean Hill's story is finally available in this book, published twenty-nine years after the assassination, without any distortion by those who would have preferred that it had never been told."

Brown ""CJB""",14/15,4.0,1143590400,So Jean Hill is no John Dean,"Just some thoughts on Jean Hill and her book.The only book I've purchased and read so far regarding the JFK assassination that gives you an insight on how (in this case) one of the witnesses life was affected by being in Dealy Plaza on that fateful day.She like most of the witnesses in Dealy Plaza said that she thought the shots came from the 'Grassy knoll'. She was man handled by so-called 'secret agents' 'Magic bullet man' also grilled her about her affair with a Dallas motorcycle Cop. He also goaded her about the `White dog she saw' which turned out to be White toy given to Jackie.Jean and her young daughter were involved in a car crash, her Lover and a mechanic friend of his checked out the car and found that the track rod ends had come loose. They like any mechanical minded person came to the conclusion that the car had been tampered with. Track rod ends just don't come loose so easily, if they did cars by necessity would have radically different steering assemblies.If you believe as I do that the witnesses in the Plaza were correct in their recollections of where the shots came from and also in their contact with (according to the official report NON EXISTANT) Dallas cops and Federal \ secret officials just minutes after the tragedy, then there must have been a conspiracy.Some reviewers have described this book as nothing more than a novel, so I looked up the words definition in the 'Collins English dictionary'Novel: An extended work in prose, either fictitious or partly so.I see, it's a novel because some reviewers disagree with Jeans recollections or because her recollections changed over the years. SO WHAT. Most peoples recollections of their life experiences change over the years, does this mean all our memories can only be fit for a Novel rather than a autobiography No.Now to why I titled this 'So Jean Hill is no John Dean' (I could have replaced John Dean with Harold Weisberg or Cyril Wecht)During the Watergate scandal John Dean being Nixons Legal counsel was set up for a big fall however because he had a photographic memory he could recall incidents and conversations in great detail without wavering under cross examination he deflected the blame to Nixon's Front line and eventually to Nixon himself.Most of us (including Jean) haven't got that type of memory or fortitude.Jean Hill passed away in 2000, she was a primary school teacher. Whenever her young students asked her to tell her story of the assassination, which in their young eyes was a part of American social history, she was always struck by their reactions.Her story will have left an indelible memory on a good percentage of them. I am sure some of the students will continue the search for the truth.Jean Hill was just an ordinary mother and schoolteacher.Arlen Specter is a Senator & highflying lawyer.Only one of them is a great American in my book: Jean Hill R.I.P."

It can't be ignored. She was filmed for Oliver Stone's movie titled JFK. She was cut from the theater production, but it is in the director's cut, which is the one you should see.

But this book only does more to discredit conspiracy theorists because it is poorly documented and reads like a novel. Probably 80% of the book is verbatim, quoted material from 30 years ago. Page after page of dialogue is quoted when all is needed is a careful summary of each exchange Ms. Hill had with various persons. It is hard to believe Ms. Hill could have remember in detail every conversation she had with every person she met over 30 years ago. I don't believe it. I think great liberty is taken in creating an interesting story but putting aside believability. It would be a good novel -- but this is bad reseach.

1012,0882899228,JFK: The Last Dissenting Witness,,,,17/29,2.0,904867200,Jean Hill has co-written a highly embellished account.,"Several years ago, I wrote a 35-page article questioning the credibility of Jean Hill by comparing her statements about the assassination from Nov. 22, 1963 onwards, with the allegations made in her book. I started out as a strong believer in what Jean had to say, until I gradually realized that she was adding more and more details to what she originally described to news and tv reporters shortly after the tragedy in Dallas, culminating in a completely different account of her experience as described in CROSSFIRE by Jim Marrs. But even earlier in remarks made to author Tony Summers, there were signs of altered recollections. I got to meet Jean at the 1991 Dallas conference and two years later at a conference held in Sudbury, Ontario, where she told me to my face that I was &quot;a thorn in her side&quot;. Well, I'm sorry she feels that way, even though she hadn't actually read my article (which numerous researchers have either bought or received from me, free of charge.) I still believe that there was a conspiracy involved in the assassination of JFK, but I feel that Jean's book is far more fiction than fact (there are no footnotes), and reads like a dimestore mystery novel. Thank goodness plans to dramatize it as a television docudrama feel through. It's too bad Oliver Stone chose to use her altered account in his film. Anyone who decides to read this book, or has already done so, should consider reading my article (&quot;Jean Hill - The Lady In Red&quot;) too.

And that is the fact that, on November 22nd, 1963 (the exact day of the event, within less than two hours of the assassination itself), Jean Hill appeared on television (via a WBAP-TV tape-recorded interview), where she explicitly says she never saw anyone firing any weapon at the President. .......QUESTION: ""Did you see the person who fired the weapon?""JEAN HILL: ""No, I didn't see any person fire the weapon.""QUESTION: ""You only heard it?""JEAN HILL: ""I only heard it.""What is a person to make of this flip-flop in Hill's testimony regarding the events of 11-22-63? In my view, her EARLIEST account of the shooting (which has been recorded on videotape for all to watch and listen to over and over again) should be looked upon as the BEST account of what she saw that Friday afternoon back in '63.But nearly thirty years later -- after having served just months earlier as an official (but uncredited) ""technical adviser"" to Oliver Stone during the making of Stone's 1991 film ""JFK"" (coincidence?) -- Hill came out with this book, which claims she ""saw a man fire at President Kennedy from the grassy knoll"".Did Jean's memory suddenly improve greatly in the intervening years? Everyone reading this publication should at least pause for a few moments to consider that question.Another major piece of Jean Hill-created ""evidence"" that is easily knocked down is her ridiculous claim of having seen Oswald's murderer, Jack Ruby, racing across the grassy knoll at the exact time of JFK's assassination.Multiple witnesses can place Jack Ruby in the Dallas Morning News building at the precise time the President was being murdered. Ruby HIMSELF, in fact, admits to having been in the DMN building at the time of the assassination.Below is a portion of the verbatim testimony given by Jack Ruby to the Warren Commission on June 7th, 1964 (from the Dallas County Jail, where Ruby was being held after having been convicted on March 14, 1964, of murdering JFK's assassin, Lee Oswald):----------""I picked up the brochure that Friday morning {November 22, 1963}, and I also had business at the {Dallas Morning} News Building on Friday, because that is the start of the weekend, which is very lucrative, the weekend.""So I went down there Friday morning to Tony Zoppi's office, and they said he went to New Orleans for a couple of days. I picked up the brochure. I believe I got downtown there at 10:30 or 11 o'clock that morning. And I took the brochure and then went into the main room where we compose our ads. That is the sales room where we placed our ads. And I remained there for a while. I started to write the copy of my ad.""Well, John Newnam comes in, and evidently he took it for granted I finished my ad, and I don't recall if he paid for his ad, and suddenly there is some milling around. I think it was 12, or 15 minutes after 12, I don't recall what, but John Newnam said someone had been shot. And I am sorry, I got carried away. It is the first time I got carried away, because I had been under pressure. And someone else came running over and he said a Secret Service man was shot, or something to that effect. And I am here in the middle with John Newnam, because Newnam isn't paying any attention to anyone else, and there is a lot of going back and forth. So someone must have made a statement that Governor Connally was shot. I don't recall what was said. And I was in a state of hysteria.""----------Therefore, how is it even remotely possible for Jean Hill to have seen Jack Ruby on the grassy knoll in Dealey Plaza at 12:30 PM when President Kennedy was being shot? Quite obviously, this is not possible.But Jean Hill and Oliver Stone (in his movie) would like to have people believe that Ruby was running around Dealey Plaza's grassy slopes at 12:30 PM on November 22, instead of where even Ruby himself admits he was at the time of the assassination (with gobs of witnesses to verify his story) -- and that's on the second floor of the Dallas Morning News building.Since this book came out in 1992, Jean Hill has passed away. She died in Dallas on November 7, 2000, at the age of 69.---------------------This book's subject matter can get you to thinking about other eyewitness accounts of the events in Dallas' Dealey Plaza (and the shooting of police officer J.D. Tippit in nearby Oak Cliff, a suburb of Dallas, a mere 45 minutes after President Kennedy was gunned down).I'm guessing that in a conspiracy theorist's fantasy world the only people with bad eyesight, or the only people capable of making an error, are those witnesses who gave testimony damning to ""Saint Oswald"" -- E.G.: Howard Brennan, Domingo Benavides, Helen Markham, Ted Callaway, Jack Tatum, Virginia Davis, Barbara Davis, William Scoggins, Johnny Brewer, Warren Reynolds, L.J. Lewis, Pat Patterson, Harold Russell, Robert Edwards, Ronald Fischer, etc.But, if we're to believe the ""CTers"", those conspiracy-favoring witnesses like Jean Hill and S.M. Holland and Acquilla Clemmons, et al, were somehow born with unimpeachable ""Conspiracy-Noticing"" skills.Acquilla Clemmons' account of the J.D. Tippit murder is taken as Gospel by many a-CTer, despite the wholly-ILLOGICAL ""plot"" that she supposedly witnessed on Tenth Street that day.....I.E.:Having TWO killers conspire to commit the Tippit murder, even though the conspirators' #1 goal here is to FRAME JUST ONE SINGLE ""PATSY"" FOR THIS MURDER (namely someone called ""Lee Harvey Oswald"").Smart, huh?Let's use TWO killers (needlessly, of course, for a practically point-blank killing of a policeman, who was just inches from the gun of the killer), instead of just using our trusty, present-at-every-murder-Oswald-supposedly-ever-committed-in-his-life ""LHO Imposter"" to do the job.From what school for covert acts did these plotters graduate -- ""The Academy For Brain-Dead Conspirators""?Nobody could be as stupid and reckless as these November 22nd Plotters/Conspirators were said to have been (per CT-slanted versions of events). Not possible. And this recklessness extends far beyond just the Tippit murder scene as well. In fact, it applies ever more so to the JFK killing in Dealey Plaza.Example:WHY in the world would these professional killers even WANT to utilize THREE teams of assassins (as Oliver Stone claims in his movie), firing six bullets potentially into their one target (JFK) from a variety of different shooting locations, when the whole idea of this intricate, supposedly-well-planned ""plot"" is to frame just a single ""Patsy"" who is supposed to be located in the Book Depository? Did these conspirators deliberately TRY to make their assassination scheme as complicated and implausible as they possibly could? Seems like it.And yet Oliver Stone actually has people buying this stuff. Kinda sad, huh? I think so anyway.Well, anyhow, whatever you do, take the contents of this book with a very large-sized grain of salt. (That advice goes double, make that triple, for viewers of Oliver Stone's motion picture as well.)"

This was the first of Patricia's books I had the displeasure to become acquainted with. I've tried reading another of her works, but I can't get over the simplistic writing with unnecessary adjectives thrown in for no apparent reason except, perhaps, to make the sentences longer and make the reader suffer from the protracted tripe.

On the down side, I think that Gault is a little too evil -- he borders on the implausible with his ability to be one step ahead of the game.

It is also the first and last Patricia Cornwell novel I will ever read. There are so many problems with this book that they cannot be listed here, so here are but three points: 1) The main character, Kay Scarpetta, is an insufferable, humorless snob. I'd never before read a novel where I hated the main character. Great job, Pat! 2) About 90% of the novel is dialogue. Very bad dialogue. But this is understandable since Cornwell cannot write prose. 3) The story is predictable and boring, and the ending is utterly ridiculous. I'm astonished that this book was ever published, let alone made the bestseller lists."
1031,B000O3QCH8,From Potter's Field,,,,2/6,1.0,968025600,My first and last Patricia Cornwell book,"I actually tried another PC book a few months ago (don't remember which one) but gave up in disgust with all of the advertising I found in it - references to AOL, Reebok and The Body shop.But I saw this book in the library and seeing as she is so popular decided to give her another chance. Big mistake. The characters in this book were wooden and the main character, Kay Scarpetta is laughable. When it is discovered that the killer on the scene knows where she lives, she blubbers about having to leave her house and car. Now here's a heroine we can get behind!!I read about 200 pages before giving up. I decided I had wasted enough of my life on this drivel. I had read in other reviews that there was one good scene in this book. I didn't get that far because I didn't find one in those 200 pages.I followed this book with &quot;Denial&quot; by Peter James and saw the difference between the insipid rubbish that Cornwell passes off as a thriller and the real thing.&quot;Denial&quot; kept me turning the pages until the end."

I know one doesn't read this kind of novel for its beautiful language, but prose on a higher level than sixth grade composition class shouldn't be out of the question either. I can count the number of metaphors used in this book on one hand, without extending any of my fingers.And the plot is...well...lame. Had it been anything other than boring, senseless tripe I would be able to overlook the complete lack of artistic craft in the book. But it wasn't.The antagonist is a drug addict, who is &quot;decompensating,&quot; yet he still manages to break into a high-security computer system in the FBI building, all the while committing murders in public places while eluding scores of policeman like the invisible man. This book would be better classified as science fiction than crime fiction.What a stinker!"

It is unrealistic, fails to capture the reader, and at points when I should have been completely engrossed, left me struggling with whether I wanted to pick it up. I hope she has written better than this, or else, there are a lot of people who have not bothered reading some of the strong authors available.Her characters are not sympathetic, they do not draw the reader's attention, and they are dull in overall scope. I have too many other good books to read before I pick up another book from this author."
1036,B000O3QCH8,From Potter's Field,,,,4/14,2.0,939686400,"More of a &quot;yawn&quot; than a &quot;scream&quot;, really...","Usually I read &quot;general fiction&quot;, but I also like to read &quot;crime novels&quot; from time to time. Of course that good &quot;crime novels&quot; also qualify as literature. Take Graham Greene, for instance, or James Ellroy, the Tinseltown Dostoyevsky. Of course that it's a very tricky business, that of writing crime novels. And unfortunately, Ms. Cornwell's &quot;From Potter's Field&quot; falls a little bellow the mark.Let's take the character development, for instance. Or rather, let us not take it, since there isn't any. Scarpetta continues to be a paranoid b***h who simply cannot stop moralising for a second (I like strong women characters; unfortunately, this one is just irritating). Lucy, whose very existence should be considered a crime, manages to be more annoying than Jar Jar Binks. Gault barely manages to be ONE-dimensional, let alone be terrifying (he's about as scary as Dr.Evil from &quot;Austin Powers&quot;. Minus the jokes.) Marino is his usual amusing cardboard self and everyone else is just walking backdrop.But let us forget character for a while. How about the plot? After all, a good plot can save a crime novel, can't it? Well, not always, but in this case there is no plot. None that Cornwell hasn't written before, that is. Think about it: someone is out on a killing spree, Scarpetta takes on the case, Scarpetta goes here and there and finally, some name is pulled out of the filofax and thrown into the page, only to have him/her shot dead (usually by Scarpetta) at the end. The only difference here is that this time we *know* who the killer is, so the plot becomes quite obvious after the first twenty pages! Not that there weren't enough intriguing possibilities around: say, what has the Army got to do with everything? Or who exactly is Gault's father? (It would be interesting if Cornwell did a &quot;Chinatown&quot; here - you know: the scene where Evelyn (Faye Dunaway) reveals who is the father of her daugther - and came up with some really nasty solution to the question of Gault's parentage. Instead, it appears that Peyton Gault's brother was shagging his wife - duh!) But unfortunately, none of this leads anywhere. The &quot;plot&quot; merely goes on undeterred in its path towards Trite-city, Predictable-land. The only thing that starts out by being vaguely arousing is the scene where Scarpetta meets the Gaults. We aren't usually treated to this kind of viewpoint in the over-simplistic Scarpetta novels, so my hopes were high. What a major disappointment, considering that that scene is handled with all the subtlety of a demolition ball wrecking a building. I know that scenes like that are very difficult to write, but surely Cornwell could have come up with something better? After some time I came to realise that the purpose of that scene was to remind us how much &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; was brilliant in its handling of the reactions of parents towards their wayward - or their lost - children.Also, since we are talking about Scarpetta meets the Gaults, let us pose a question: why, pray tell, is there no explanation concerning Gault's fixation on Scarpetta? And consider the following situation: two twin siblings, very similar genetic traits, very similar upbringing... so why was Jayne Gault such an angel and Temple Gault such a demon? Should we start calling for father Merrin here? (OK, so he snorts about six lines of coke a day, but so did Drew Barrymore before her reinvention and never was she seen indulging in a killing spree.) Also, if it was so obvious from such an early age that Temple Gault had some serious problems, why didn't his parents commit him to an institution? Did they hope that he would grow out of it? In a word, Conrwell's tidbits concerning Gault are pure and simply bizarre. It's so ironic that I re-read the brilliant &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; by Patricia Highsmith before I picked up &quot;From Potter's Field&quot; - what a glaring contrast. Gault the classical Anti-christ? Compared to the wonderfully textured Tom Ripley he is just a complete ninny.There were some other things that left some bitter aftertaste in my mouth, such as the ever-present pro-death penalty stance (alright, Patricia, we know what your opinion is... enough already, OK?) and characters being fans of Ayn Rand's books (eek!!!). But considering the former, doesn't Cornwell know that the US is the only industrialised Western country to still have the death penalty? (Here in Portugal we got rid of that *in the late 1800s*.) Doesn't she realise that her arguments either mean absolutely nothing to the other countries where this is being sold or simply irritate lots of people there (myself included)? Also, why does Cornwell insist in portraying Scarpetta &amp; mates as defenders of a featureless society against criminals that are portrayed as &quot;complete outsiders&quot;? Is she afraid to face the real texture of a corrupt society, such as in &quot;Seven&quot;, for instance, and deal with the underlying problems? Since crime has been a feature of almost all human societies from the dawn of time, how about devoting some pages to that issue, instead of brushing it under the carpet?But I see this is getting too long, and I believe that I have stated the reasons to why &quot;From Potter's Field&quot; was a complete waste of time and money. If you want to read an interesting crime novel - a *real* novel - from the female perspective, read &quot;Smilla's Sense of Snow&quot;. If you insist in reading &quot;From Potter's Field&quot; go ahead, but don't say you haven't been warned. As for me, this was not the first Cornwell novel I read, but it will certainly be the last."

I thought this book was pretty good, and exciting. Yes, the plot is a little thinner than previous books, and yes Kay does wear on one after a time, but the forensics are awesome, and the suspense keeps on and on. I do have to admit that I do tire of Lucy somewhat. To me the books would be better without that added character. In this book Kay, Marino and Wesley are on the trail of the infamous Temple Gault (Kay's long time nemesis). The story is set around the week from Christmas Eve to New Year's Eve, but a lot happens in that short time. We see Kay, Marino and Wesley panicking as they try to nail down what seems to be the most notorious serial killer in the country at that time. Pretty good stuff!"

Griffith,2/3,2.0,1010102400,Not very much depth or substance to this one,"The house we stayed in for New Years had a ton of books on its shelves and since it was raining a lot we had plenty of time to read. I picked up this book New Years Eve and finished it New Year's Day. I chose it for a couple of reasons, first off I had just finished a historical book and it was time for something light and I had recently seen a 20/20 episode where Patricia Cornwell claimed to have solved the identity of Jack the Ripper. So I was intrigued. I like mystery and thrillers and I knew she had written a lot of books in the genre and my wife had read several of hers and liked them. First off I must say that Patricia was stretching the word per page ratio with this book. I was reading the hard cover edition and the margins were very wide and each paged ended like 3 inches from the bottom with some silly footer taking up a lot of space. Secondly and partially as a consequence it was a very fast read. Finally I would not recommend this book, but it was entertaining in some regards. I don't know about any of her other novel's (I think I will check out one more of her's as a fair shake, in particular there was one book that one a bunch of awards one year that looks promising) but I found this to be a weak example of the genre. Lets face it, in any genre there are real works of literature that are the top of that particular genre, say Tolkien in fantasy, I am not sure what is the supreme literary example of mysteries but whatever it may be this was a bland consume. I didn't really care for it much. It is basically your typical psycho serial killer vs. the ""law enforcement"" individual. In this case Cornwell's hero is a heroine, Kay Scarpetta and Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia, for which I think she has earned a lot of interest. However for a thriller of this type I enjoy James Patterson's Alex Cross series much better."

Although if the good guys had known some basic details about the killer's family tree, Dr Kay would have been left twiddling her thumbs, so I suppose I should quit complaining.Well, I read the book right through to the end, and it kept me amused, so I have to give it one star."

I didn't like it. And i thought i might be in for a disappointing Cornwellian offering.My, was i WRONG.This book is yet another stunner. She has definitely veered away from the cunningness and cleverness which inhabited her first three books. But she more than makes up for it with a chilling plot and one of the most cold and clinical serial killers i have eve read of. Essentially, this is a serial killer novel, and as that it not especially original. But it is nonetheless a good one.Marino, Benton, Lucy and of course Kay are back again for another great read. Cornwell's writing is sharp and to the point, and keeps the you turning those pages. I can't really put my finger on a reason why, but from the first time i read a Cornwell book i feel in love with the way she writes. It's simply...wonderful. I can't get enough of it. It's no more literate than the next person's, but for some reason i just relish every sentence she writes.The plot here is sometimes scatty and random (as was Cruel and Unusual) but here, she pulls it off a lot better. I tend not to like books full of random killings, without rhyme or reason (yoo hoo, James Patterson, author of Violets are Blue, i'm talking in particular about you.), but here i really did. The randomness is chilling, and Tenple Gault is a super villain, who curdles the blood. He is just so...hateable. You loathe him absolutely. Especially when you find out how he treats his sister. You just hate him even more. With every part of i wanted him to die, die, die. It is hard to conceieve of anyone so cruel and horrifically terrifying than him. When Scarpetta talks to his parents, it's painful to read, even though it's fiction. It's an extremely moving scene, full of emotion. (As is the entire book.)This book moves along relentlessly to it's absolutely brilliant conclusion. It is the best conclusion she has penned yet, down in the bowels of the New York subway. Dark and frightening, she really brings over the atmosphere.I loved this book, as i have loved almost every single Scarpetta novel so far.The identity of the first victim should come as a real shock."
1079,B000O3QCH8,From Potter's Field,,A4KDYV44L0I0,Jenn McNeil,14/15,3.0,1052870400,The Life of the Chief Medical Examiner?,"I am currently taking a murder mystery class at my college. I have not read many murder mysteries before this class. We have read a variety of novels for this class, with the most number of novels by one author being three. The one Patricia Cornwell novel our class read is ""From Potter's Field."" I very much enjoyed this novel, though I think it should be considered a thriller instead of a murder mystery. The novel also had some hard to believe aspects about it, which were difficult for the members of my class to look beyond.Why should this novel be labeled a thriller and not a murder mystery? Well, the reader clearly knows who the murder is. Dr. Kay Scarpetta, the Chief Medical Examiner, has the feeling the murderer is her ""nemesis,"" Temple Gault with plenty of reason. The only mysteries are for her to prove Gault is the murder, identify the first body of the girl, ""Jane"" and of course to find Gault, before he finds her. A thriller is also more appropriate because it had several moments that were extremely suspenseful, the kind that makes the hairs on your neck stand up. There is a section of the novel where there is a murder in Kay's office building and she believes the killer is still in the building. As she walks around the building, you expect Gault to jump out at any moment. There is also another section in which a trap is set for Gault in NYC's subway system. Not knowing whether or not he'll show up had me on the edge of my proverbial seat.As much as I liked this novel, there were several things that irked me about it. A Chief Medical Examiner seems more like an office, administrative position than a really, REALLY hands on job. Kay almost takes on the role of a detective. I could almost believe her occasional tasks of doing autopsies, but to travel to see a suspect's family seems over the top. Cornwell tried to combine too many types of people into just one character. Kay is the Chief Medical Examiner, technician, administrator, loving aunt and family member (sister and daughter), mistress, detective, seemingly EVERYONE'S friend, CIA/FBI associate, and still has time to be the nemesis of a serial killer. How the woman has time to eat is beyond me. Cornwell also did not take the time to really develop Kay as a character. It is far more difficult for a writer to show you what someone is like opposed to telling you information. Cornwell clearly is a teller, hence the really wordy and winded sections of the novel. This writing style is not as affective in writing a believable novel.I did find a unique aspect of the novel for me, personally. I'm from NYC and grew up there. I really could visualize the sections of the novel that described Central Park, the Museum of Natural History and the subway area at the end. It just added a realistic element to the novel that initially bought my interest in it.Overall, the novel's plot flowed for me, even with the occasional extremely unrealistic sections and poor writing. The ending was a big let down for me, but decide for yourself. If you're looking for a thriller with entertaining potential, give this Cornwell novel a try."
1080,B000O3QCH8,From Potter's Field,,A20RPFDSQBHJ26,director man,4/4,2.0,1137196800,Very Dissapointing,"From Potters Field is one Patricia Cornwell's worst book she has written. It's not the characters, nope. It's not the writing that is wrong. It's the story that makes the book disappointing.Temple Gault has struck again. This time we know this for sure. Both the readers and Kay Scarpetta do. Someone from Lucy's past is also back. The problem with this book is that Gault is not a strong enough villain to carry this book. He is not scary or very threatening. It's not exiting. Partly because we never get into his head we are always inside Scarpetta's. Even if Cornwell did venture inside his head I'm not sure if it would be that exiting. For a killer on the loose plot its very weak, of coarse the forensics are very good and original. But for the most part a very disappointing Scarpetta novel."

I was half way through the first chapter when I went back to the store and bought all the books in the series that came before. This is the best there has been.

Kay's affair with Benton is disappointing to me since she seems to pride herself on ""doing the right thing."" Lucy was insufferable in this one. She was younger in ""Cruel and Unusual"" and I could overlook her idiosyncracies, but she's older now and needs to get a grip - she almost seems to resent or dislike Kay at times but then turns around and loves her again. Also, Lucy's genius IQ and role as an FBI computer program writer who busts crime with her keyboard are beyond corny.The best part IMO was the scene in the morgue, as others have said. I don't think I would have been able to put the book down if a tornado had ripped through my house while I was reading that part!It is difficult to believe that a crazy guy high on cocaine most of the time could always be one step ahead of the police and FBI, brutally murdering people right under their noses and getting away with it.But then the worst came. The ending. Wham, bam, it's over, with Temple Gault's fate implied but none of the juicy details I was hungering for. There wasn't even a page break - one second we're in the subway tunnels of New York, the next we're flying over Potter's Field. Huh?"

The interpersonal relationships among the &quot;good guys&quot; -- Kay, Benton, Marino, Janet and Lucy -- added texture and enhanced the suspense. And I enjoyed moving from Virginia to New York to Hilton Head with Kay. BUT this ending! So much action brings us to a very unsatisfying climax.

So many of them are hard-edged or not very warm, which is also true of Dr. Kay, though I do like that she is a strong, capable woman. Unlike others, I don't see Kay's affair with Wesley as some moral affront. While I don't say it's right, it is part of real life, and it helps to show Kay's softer, more vulnerable side.

But I don't like Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta stories. It's very hard to differentiate between her characters, and the &quot;surprise ending&quot; leaves the reader feeling cheated, as there is no development leading up to the conclusion. One feels as if one has read a several hundred page prologue to a short story. Instead of character development, we are treated to the condition of the women character's breasts (perky, upright, sagging, fat) and just how much the male characters smoke.The main character, Kay Scarpetta, is hugely judgemental, frighteningly paranoid, and irritatingly egotistical. The story grinds to a halt here and there as Kay spouts off yet another moralizing homily about the right to privacy (except when SHE needs information), the right to own an arsenal of weapons, and the right to sleep with someone else's husband. Oh, and the right to be unbearable after giving up smoking. (For one painted as such a sterling genius, the whole smoking emphasis suffuses the book with an overtone of cognitive dissonance.)The idea is interesting. The sketch of characters is interesting. Patricia Cornwell needs to get out the way and let the story flow."

The plot was terrific, and the characters are so real. After reading the book you feel like you know them. Cornwell also does a great job of making the crimes and detailed as possible.

I'm glad I started with &quot;All That Remains&quot;, and not this book. Come on I know how she feels being involved with a married man, but I don't wish to be reminded of all the negative possessive, crazy, feelings that take over your mind. I like her acknowledgement in &quot;The Body Farm&quot; that this was not morally right, but that it felt too good to stop. I enjoyed her interactions with people much better in her earlier Dr. Scarpetta works than in this one. While the mystery is still fast paced and has you holding your breath, the interpersonal relations suck. I read to find a relief from having to deal daily with this type of people. Ms. Cornwell has the right idea to get you to identify with Kay, but I had a hard time feeling comfortable identifying with Kay in this book. I've been stressed out, &quot;b***hy&quot;, and &quot;crazied&quot;, over life and men, but I don't read to be reminded of those unpleasant aspects of life and people. My advise to Ms. Cornwell is to have Dr. Scarpetta to &quot;get a grip&quot;. Deal with life and have fun, don't get lost in the small things. I also have enjoyed the interplay of Kay's relationship with Benton Wesley much more than with Mark James. I like the idea that Benton is a completion of Kay, a ying to her yang. I wish I knew more men like him who can stand up to a strong-willed, intelligent professional woman and make her a more whole person. I hope Ms. Cornwell will &quot;fix&quot; Kay in her next book, and flesh out a happy relationship between her and Benton (less negative thoughts, more enjoyment and smooth working between the two), and &quot;fix&quot; Lucy too-its ok if she has an alternative lifestyle if you want, but if you don't want her to be happy in this fashion, find her a boyfriend, not another girlfriend(!!!). I agree with the comments from her next book on Lucy, stop beating a dead horse with Lucy, make her a semi-functional character, or get rid of ! her. In closing, this series on Dr. Scarpetta is a refreshing type of mystery that keeps you on your toes and looking over your shoulder for the killer. I throughly enjoy her style of writing and would recommend her previous books to anyone. However, this book was a grave disappointment, I had come to expect a cool strong-willed, compentent, Dr. Scarpetta, and all I found was a decompensating shell of her former self. If you've read her earlier books you may want to steer away from this one. I found myself greiving for Kay and Ms. Cornwell after finishing this book. Come on lets find the old Kay who has character and stamina to have a great mystery adventure."

This psychopath is Kay Scarpetta's nemesis and New York is his home turf, which puts her at a definite disadvantage. Gault leaves special clues knowing Scarpetta will know it's his calling card and lure her closer to his trap for her. She knows she's in his web and he's drawing her ever closer but she is not able to stay away, for doing so would keep him free to increase his fatality rate.This has to be my favorite Patricia Cornwell book. I loved the game of cat and mouse that Gault plays with Scarpetta. I loved the way Scarpetta plays the game determined to win no matter what Gault tries to throw at her. And I especially loved the gift of the scalpel and the chase through the subway tunnels all over New York City (I can't say anymore without giving away too much!).This book is constant action with no slowing down so the reader can catch his/her breath. It's almost as if the same cat and mouse game being played between Scarpetta and Gault is being copied between Cornwell and the reader. I found myself ""reading just one more chapter"" so I could figure it all out and Cornwell keeping those answers just a few pages out of my reach. Oh sure, she'd dangle a carrot to tease me, a little morsel to keep me going, but kept me chasing the answers until the end!If you want a book that will help you relax before you go to bed or a book that will leave you with a feeling that all is wonderful in the world, pick up a book of poetry because this is definitely not the book for you.

Also, please don't TELL us that Gault is the worst murderer of the century, SHOW us. Prove it! My personal quibble is that when our heroine is talking with a woman's father and he asks if his daughter is dead, Kay answers with a flat yes, when at most she's got a hunch as to the identity of the dead woman. This is inconceivable for a forensic pathologist whose specialty is not only what she knows, but what she can prove.

Then finding out the actual identity of the woman and her relationship with the killer was amazing. Patricia Cornwell's books always have the best, most intreguing characters. For example, the physco-pathic killer, Gault, was such a master-mind at what he did.

She is a compelling storyteller, and she obviously possesses great knowledge of the subject matter. I do admit to finishing the book in a two-day period, but it was more to get to the inevitable final showdown between Scarpetta and the killer. Scarpetta and some of her cronies are characterized well, but the killer seemed a bit stereotypical. I don't believe in reading ahead and spoiling the surprise, but in this case I skipped some detailed sections to find out how the killer would be stopped in his tracks.Since reading this book, I have read Cause of Death by Cornwell and would rate that book slightly higher than this one. This book is not her best that I've read so far, but it wouldn't prevent me from reading another one.This is a good, focused, and knowledgable writer who does not need to fall back on unbelievable killers and sensantional plot devices to tell an imaginative story."

Cornwell's villain, this coke-snorting psychopath, ends up surrounded by all the forces known to man, in New York City anyway. The FBI, the city police, the transit police, you name it. I ended up rooting for the guy to escape, that's how repelled I was by Cornwell's climax, or was it an anti-climax? Was it nothing more than a severed femoral artery?I did learn something from this book: the subways in New York are confusing and homeless people can sleep there. Oh, and I learned that computers have evolved a lot since this book was written.So to sum up, I don't know which book was more boring, this one or Atlas Shrugged, but neither one is really worth reading, I'd say.

However, any momentum the book hopes to attain is thwarted time and time again by her stereotypical characters. Why does every man have to be a one-dimensional macho idiot who can't believe that a woman can hold such a serious job? Does Cornwell truly believe that men are like this? Meanwhile, Scarpetta and her niece Lucy are depicted as physically fit, attractive geniuses who eagerly whip up a seven course Italian dinner after working a 16 hour day, everyday. I forgot to mention they are rich and always level-headed with never an 'off' day. Essentially these characters have no challenges left except for contrived (mostly relationship) problems. Scarpetta ponders being perfect while not being loved or able to let herself love another. Well, if she didn't love herself so much that would be a first step. She's definitely egocentric. Lucy would be as egocentric, but alas, she is humbled through her worship to her shrine - Scarpetta. Lucy was almost challenged with alcoholism but thankfully that challenge ended after a few months (yet another narrow escape from character development). Lucy also has a hard time with relationships and can't seem to find that right person who complements her intellect and beauty on an even level. To wit, it's lonely at the top. Being perfect is attainable - 1) love yourself first, 2) stay single, 3) proceed with a monastic life of studying all day and night, 4) learn to cook. And remember: what being over-worked, grossly over-sensitive, and self absorbed don't do for your heart and social life they make up for in your bank account and your bloated sense of self-importance."

(why not just arrest him as he leaves his apartment building, once they have found that?); can you believe that a trained law enforcement person would leave her gun lying around as many times as the dimwit heroine does in this book?Worse than this are the many things that Cornwell throws in that end up having no role in the book--a sick mother in Florida, a subplot abpout her sidekick's love life, her niece's lesbian romances.This book is all filler, no substance.

The twists and turns in the plot were simply to convenient for me to appreciate a sense of natural flow that good novels must have. For example: The scene in which Gault (the killer) has been seen using the same restaurant that the main character spontaneously finds herself in. Imagine, in New York no less! Not only that, but the killer is using the main characters visa in the same restaurant. And then the genius software engineer niece who just happens to be working on a huge computer program in the law enforcement field. I'm sorry, but this tale is just to unbelievable.

1153,B000O3QCH8,From Potter's Field,,,,6/10,1.0,959990400,"400+ pages, with only one good scene","Does anybody really believe that when a joint FBI/police/medical examiner team needs to locate West Coast dental specialists quickly, they would decide the best way is TO SPAM EVERY USER ON PRODIGY asking for a knowledgable dentist to contact them?This book has so many problems, I hardly know where to start. They fall into two main areas -- no, not the print and the page, the pages, at least, are innocent! There are editorial problems, and problems inherent in a story that reads as if it didn't have the author's full attention.Let's begin with the editorial problems. Do you believe that sirens can &quot;whelp&quot; through the sky? (and is that why we say it's raining cats and dogs? or at least, puppies?)Dialogue moves in and out of a &quot;no contractions&quot; zone, which has the characters suddenly using formal diction -- maybe ONE character in modern America could get away with this, but most of them? How often do senior cops and med. examiners, in casual conversation, say &quot;I will not&quot; and &quot;I do not&quot; instead of &quot;I won't&quot; or &quot;I don't&quot;? It's the unevenness that is jolting and extremely irritating, as if there were multiple editors, one of whom didn't believe in contractions while the others did.But the editors can't be blamed for the plot problems and general stupidity of the characters. How many times are we expected to believe that people who are told every other sentence that they should not go out alone have yet again gone out alone? One second they're talking about putting Scarpetta into the Federal Witness Protection scheme and the next, she's going into work 2 hours early so she'll have the whole building to yourself -- does anybody think the readers will be surprised when You Know Who intrudes on Scarpetta's early-morning solitude? It happens repeatedly. It's like a B-grade horror movie -- the characters are idiots who walk stupidly into danger they could easily avoid. But then there'd be no book (not necessarily a bad thing).The main character's resemblance to Superman pales quickly. In a crime scene, only Scarpetta will spot the incriminating footprint. In a crowd scene, only Scarpetta will spot the suspect in the crowd. Why bother with all the other police/FBI/NY Transit Police?Even so, Scarpetta doesn't detect much, she mostly intuits. If more than one person could have done something, you can bet that Scarpetta knows which one did it. How? She just knows. Maybe the rest of the team doesn't know whether the killer is in Virginia or NY, but Scarpetta does. Why? She just knows. If one character has a high-ranking uncle, and she hears that another is vaguely rumored to be related to someone important, you can bet that she'll guess the two are siblings, and she'll be right, and the reader will not get any more explanation. As a reader, I feel cheated -- where is the detection? If I wanted to read about clairvoyance, I'd be reading books in a different genre.The ONE redeeming feature is the scene in which Scarpetta meets the parents of the serial killer. That jumps off the page. What is it like to have your child turn out to be a monster? How would you react? Cornwell should have developed this, made it the focus of the book, have Scarpetta skillfully tease useful information from the parents, DO SOME DETECTION, instead of having her charging around with an arsenal, hopping planes and FBI 'copters all over the East Coast until you, the reader, feel the jet lag.If Cornwell can write that scene, why did she write 400 pages of drivel to wrap around it? I know that she's a well-known, well-respected author, but she was really asleep at the wheel for this one.I only wish Amazon would let you give a book ZERO stars."

There were 2 things that ruined my enjoyment of this book:1) the main reason was that the plot, and Kay's actions, were totally illogical - someone who is afraid of a murderer stalking her would be more careful than Kay was, for instance... Unlike what I'd expect from a professional dective, Kay Scarfetta doesn't use logic but follows her intuitions, which don't seem to be based on anything but her vague feelings that it must be saw, and each and every one of those feelings turn out to be true... That doesn't make the book very believavle...2) when an author writes a more than one novel wuth the same main character, you could casually pick up of of the books in the middle of the 'series', or even the last book of it, and have a pretty good idea of what's going on, even though you'd have a much broader outlook of things if you read the previous books in the series. But not only does PC use Kay Scarffeta as her main character in numerous books, but she brings Temple Brooks Gault, the villain, back from the past, without giving a thorough background of his and Kay's history, just a little line saying Gault has some things to resent about the detective... And so on... This is just one examples of past characters and occurances that are mentioned in this book that occured or were introduced in the past, and there are so many of them that it really makes the book very vague and gives you a feeling you don't understand even half of it without having read the previous books. This might be OK for fans of the author but it doesn't make casual readers, like me, want to research enough to get the prior books and read them...."

Right from the prologue i was hooked i couldnt put it down. I read through this book quicker than any of the other Scarpetta novels.It is interesting to see how Kay started off owning just one gun in the first novel, a Ruger .38. And now she has an entire arsenal in her garage.Temple Gault is definatly the most well known of the Scarpetta villans, he is a pure evil killing machine. Although he never actually appears in the book for long periods of time there is always that sence of danger, that he might be around soemwhere, and that he is capable of everything. That is what's so intimidating about him.Overall Scarpetta has created a classic here, itll keep you hooked right up until the climax when Scapetta finally goes head to head with Gault in a deadly battle of wills that will have you on the edge of your seat in excitment.Well doen Miss Cornwell!!!"

It begins with Kay and Marino working Sheriff Santa's route through bad parts of Richmond. It isn't a Merry Christmas for these poor folks, and it becomes miserable for Kay when she's called to NYC. Temple Gault has struck again, and he's as brutal as ever.Gault just can't leave Kay alone. He's attacking everyone who is near (and sometimes dear) to her, including her niece and the top-secret computer program.And I wanted to care throughout this book. And I tried to care. But, when I got to the part where Marino, Lucy, and Janet were playing security in Kay's house, I had to stop. I was bored with the story. I read some spoilers on here, and decided to read the last two pages for myself. ::yawn::There are not just one or two important subplots, but about 50 gazillion thrown in to the mix. In addition to several murders, there's Frances and her team, Apollonia, Carrie, James, etc.Kay is still a complete snob. What's worse is that she is still carrying on her affair with the married guy. That causes unnecessary drama. I don't pity her bad choices in men.I'd say skip this book, unless you are a fan who needs to know how Temple Gault is brought down. Even then, like other reviewers have done, skip the boring parts.

The protagonist, Kay Scarpetta, is shop-worn and new characters are introduced but never developed.

The events are gruesome, but this is a coroner we are reading about, so that is to be expected. Cornwell does not exhaust the reader with gore and that made the subject matter easier to handle.The one criticism I do have is that the story moved so fast that I felt I was sometimes missing something.

Marino, Agent Wesley, and her niece Lucy.However, this book left a bad after-taste in my mouth. The story moves at a very fast pace, but then that's about the only thing that is good about this book. Rest everything is about average. Sadly, Cornwell tries to inculcate fear of Gault in the reader's mind, but nothing much seems to happen to Scarpetta anyway, despite her working in what could very well be the least secure government offices in the world! Just about anyone can break in, at anytime, anyone can make anything disappear, anyone can crack any security protocol and encrypted passwords - one seems to wonder how's the place still standing!It reminded me of those spoof teenage horror movies, where the favourite quip is ""don't open that door..."", or ""someone was lurking in the shadows, and I was alone..."".

1183,B0007ER3UO,The Starchild Trilogy,,A1BKXSV0FNCQ9A,Rence Reeves,2/2,4.0,1110153600,"The First Two Books Were Really Good, But....","I just finished the last book of the STARCHILD TRILOGY by Pohl and Williamson last week. I thought the first book REEFS OF SPACE was the best.Some of the things I liked about REEFS OF SPACE:The Plan Of Man - A super-computer which runs all human affairs. Citizens must constantly check-in at computer terminals for orders ie. before beginning work, after completing each task, before leaving a room, after entering a room etc.Risks - People who have performed badly, underachieved, or been caught performing unplanned actions or having unplanned thoughts.The Collar - An explosive collar worn by the Risks which can be detonated at anytime The Plan Of Man sees fit. It also explodes automatically if tampered with.The Body Bank - If a Risk continues to screw up or underachieve there is still one way he can contribute to society by providing body parts for transplanting onto or into those citizens who need them in order to remain useful to society.The JunkMan - A man built by using body parts and made to look exactly like one of the donors at The Body Bank in order to take his place so that this donor could escape, the only person ever to do so.There was some cool scientific stuff too; jetless drive, Hoyle theory, simbiotic relationships. But all that mumbo-jumbo means little to me. Just call me Olaf Simpleton because it was the simpler concepts which I found entertaining and interesting.One thing left me cold....At one point in the story someone says that they've known several people who were sent to The Body Bank, but they've never known anyone to recieve a body part from there. Nothing else was ever mentioned about that.=============================Book II=============================The first book of THE STARCHILD TRILOGY (The Reefs Of Space) I gave four stars. This book (STARCHILD) is not quite as good as the first one. I can't give it 3-1/2 stars so I'll round up and settle with giving it four stars also.In THE REEFS OF SPACE you're shown how The Plan Of Man super-computer affects and controls every aspect of daily life for the citizens of Earth and it's colonies. You also get to experience what it's like to wear The Collar and a really good tour of The Body Bank. In STARCHILD The Collar is still a big part of the story, but only brief mention is made of The Body Bank. This second book of the trilogy also gives an up close and personal view of The Plan Of Man super-computer. You get to see how it needs human extensions of itself, humans who can be completely trusted. You're shown what it takes to become a companion of the computer; the education and training involved, the surgical modifications needed, and the sacrafice of ""self"" and the leaving behind of all that had been a part of your previous life, including loved ones. You also get to see what it's like to live out on the reefs as free men, out of the reach of The Plan Of Man. The climactic ending is great.If you intend reading the entire trilogy I suggest you stop after this book, I could hardly finish ROGUE STAR(the third book). You DO need to read the first book(The Reefs Of Space), but I'd say the conclusion of STARCHILD is adequate enough to wrap up the series.=============================BOOK III============================This trilogy got progressively worse for me. The first book (REEFS OF SPACE) I really liked and it was my favorite, but by the time I reached the final pages of the third book (ROGUE STAR) I didn't really know where the authors were heading with it and I really didn't care.I felt they had abandoned some earlier concepts a little too early, and perhaps could have pursued and developed other story-lines further. I hate when that happens! Abandoning one really cool concept or story-line for a lame one. I couldn't buy into that ""infant star has a crush on a beautiful woman"" thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. It ate her boyfriend and that's why it has feelings for her. Still not sold."

Stevens,2/6,1.0,1136073600,I hope no one takes this book seriously,"A synopsis of the first chapter: around 12,000 BCE, three very powerful civilizations existed in and around the Mediterranean. Atlantis was a mini-continent in the Atlantic Ocean west of the Straight of Gibraltar. The Osirian Empire was located in the basin of what is now the Mediterranean Sea and the Rama Empire existed throughout Persia and into India. The civilizations of both Atlantis and Rama possessed flying airships, very similar to those commonly reported as modern-day UFOs. In addition, the Rama Empire had some type of laser-based weapon. They used anti-gravity technology to levitate giant cut stones weighing three million pounds into position at a site in modern-day Lebanon as a landing pad for their airships.According to Jared Diamond, a preeminent cultural anthropologist, the development of agriculture did not occur until around 11,000 BCE and was localized in the Fertile Crescent until 7,500 BCE. Since one can trace food surpluses as a requirement for the settlement of cities and subsequent development of technology in cultures all over the world, it seems unlikely, at best, that the Rama Empire possessed airships, laser weapons and anti-gravity technology before humans domesticated the pea (in 8,500 BCE). It just seems a little difficult to believe that in between hunting and gathering, people had time to construct flying ships, weaponize lasers and employ anti-gravity technology. This is especially remarkable given that it took humans 14,000 years to redevelop the technology for flight and we still haven't been able to weaponize lasers or develop anti-gravity technology.The book may appeal to people looking for an interesting read, but it should not be taken as a scholarly work. In fact, the author's attempts to cite scholarly sources and research to justify his claims are laughable. Also, there are numerous typographical errors (mostly omitted prepositions and possessives as well as punctuation errors)."

He thoroughly covers all of the major and most of the minor historical sites to be found throughout Africa and Arabia, often at great personal risk. It took guts to make the journeys he has made, many of which were in areas very dangerous for Americans, and a talent for writing to make them interesting.

Whether one swallows DHC's views on Atlantis or the 'Osirian Empire' is really beside the point, as this book's value lies primarily in its entertaining and evocative travelogue, not in any pretensions to accuracy. Even if DHC's theories are completely bogus, his books still make entertaining reading.The reviewers who dismiss DHC's books as worthless because he isn't a scientist and engages in speculation (sample sentence: ""1932 was a good year for mysterious ancient roads in Kenya"") are themselves remarkably clown-like in their earnest simplicity. The book provides an argument against them in the form of a great quote from Robert Louis Stevenson: ""for God's sake give me a young man who has brains enough to make a fool of himself!""Previous African travelogues I read include Shiva Naipaul's 'North of South' and Paul Theroux's 'Dark Star Safari', both of them sardonic, near-misanthropic works. While DHC doesn't have a literary style to match those accomplished authors, his wide-eyed optimism and childlike sense of adventure at least make an interesting contrast to the jaded cynicism of Naipaul and Theroux.As one would expect from someone who has hitchhiked through the Middle East and Africa, DHC is full of entertaining travel tales and encounters with amusing characters, like the Palestinian truck driver he gets a lift with in Jordan who makes an unexpected stop at a tent in the desert, which turns out to be a brothel, then emerges minutes later zipping his pants up, saying ""no good, no good...""In Israel he is taken to hospital with gangrene, and just as he is about to be treated, finds the place is suddenly deserted. The doctors have all gone home for the sabbath, and he has to wait another two days for treatment...One part of the book that intrigued me dealt with the mysterious Tuaregs of the Ahaggar mountains in southern Algeria. Their chief town is called Tamanrasset (i.e. Taman-Ra-Set)...a survival of ancient Egyptian paganism in a remote pocket of the Islamic world? The Arabs are said to be afraid of these mountains, and many eerie and surrealistic tales are told of them.DHC's book will appeal to those who like hitchhiking travel stories, or those who like esoteric speculation (or both). I doubt it will appeal to puritanical empiricists, but there are plenty of other books they can read instead."

Mr. Childress' travel stories, and his telling of &quot;wacky&quot; theories of the places he visits.

Then again, &quot;Godzilla vs. Monster Zero&quot; wasn't a very &quot;good&quot; (if we must assign labels) movie. Childress, a &quot;maverick archaeologist&quot; who seems to spend most of his time floundering around grimly impoverished Third World locales and getting nowhere with evasive women at bars, provides an insanely amusing travelogue of his journeys through the jungles and exotic landscapes of Africa and Arabia, commenting along the way on the unknown Atlantean, Lemurian, and other civilizations that flourished once upon a time and were responsible for the Pyramids, THE MAHABHARATA, and presumably Jimmy Hoffa's and D.B. Cooper's whereabouts. The most insane thing about this book is that a lot of it might be true. So far as I know, we still know very little about the Neolithic era, and the concept of &quot;lost&quot; civilizations would imaginably appeal to many readers depressed at the state of the world (including myself). However, I must agree with the other negative reviewer that Childress offers no convincing evidence to support his theories (and not very much UNconvincing evidence, either). The only sources he uses are hopelessly mossbound Victorian &quot;explorers&quot; (who knows how many African bearers' lives they may have used up to supply this book with fodder for speculation?) who had their own &quot;issues&quot; to deal with.

He paints Lincoln's portrait onto the background of the sectional conflict that led to the Civil War. Originally published about 1961, Donald's stories remain fresh and relevant. In fact the reader will encounter the thesis and outline for his recent prize-winning biography of Lincoln. I first encoutered LR in 1962 when I taught Advanced Placement American History and assigned portions of the book to my students. They loved it; you will. Donald is a superlative historian and stylist. Listen to these chapter headings: Getting Right With Lincoln, Reconsideration of Abolitionists, Herndon and Mrs. Lincoln, Folklore Lincoln, An Excess of Democracy. Readers of Donald's Lincoln will want to have this as a companion reference piece. It's rare for an historian's essays to experience such a rich and extended publishing history. Here's a quote from my faded copy of LR, a touch of wisdom for our parlous times: &quot;...Lincoln knew that there were limits rational human activity, and that there was no virtue in irritably seeking to perform the impossible. As President, he could only do his best to handle problems as they arose and have a patient trusdt that popular support for his solutions would be forthcoming. But the ultimate decision was beyond his, or any man's, control. 'Now at the end of three years struggle,' he said, 'the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man, devised, or expected. God alone can claim it.'&quot; Page after page runs like this, and virtually every theme connected to the Civil War gets enough discussion to stimulate and edify."

First published in 1956 and now in its third edition, the essays have worn well, providing great insight into Lincoln the man as opposed to Lincoln the myth, much in the vein of Richard N. Current's The Lincoln Nobody Knows. Had Donald accomplished nothing else this would be a valuable addition to everyone's Lincoln reference library. But the value of Donald's insights goes beyond those of Lincoln and his era. As a former Advanced Placement United States Government and Politics teacher, there is much in this slim volume that is instructive for our contemporary divided America, essays relevant and useful in today's classrooms. And insights which serve as a warning, particularly his comment that, ""At only one time have rigid ideologists dominated our national government--the Sumners of the North, the Jefferson Davises of the South--and the result was near disaster."" (p. 13) Let us pray in 2013 that history does not repeat itself. In more or less chronological order Donald examines: Getting Right With Lincoln, The Folklore Lincoln, Toward a Reconsideration of Abolitionists, An Excess of Democracy: The American Civil War and the Social Process, Education Defective: Lincoln's Preparation for Greatness, Herndon and Mary Lincoln, Refighting the Civil War, The Radicals and Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln and the American Pragmatic Tradition, A Whig in the White House, Reverence for the Laws: Abraham Lincoln and the Founding Fathers, and A. Lincoln, Politician. In each essay Donald challenges conventional wisdom and asks the reader to reconsider what he or she may have thought to be established fact. He also frequently confronts historiography that he considers to be biased, narrow minded, or serving an agenda. It's okay to ""get right"" with Lincoln in the sense of looking to Lincoln for guidance in challenging times; it's not okay to do so by removing him from the proper context of his times or to pretend that he could do no wrong. Those readers who own a copy of any of Donald's other books will certainly want this as a companion volume."

While awkward, that title was certainly perceptive. This book takes research that perhaps never found a place in other papers or books about Lincoln and uses it to show us a different way to see him and the events leading to the Civil War.This book contains numerous interesting bits of information about Lincoln although the one piece I found most interesting was the fact that Lincoln was a land surveyor for a time. Many writers focus on Lincoln's limited education but a surveyor must have a good understanding of mathematics and by most accounts, Lincoln was very competent. This brings to issue the long standing belief that Lincoln had little formal education but,according to the author, Lincoln's formal education was consistant with that received by young people at that time.There are some sections of this book where Lincoln's name fails to appear and the reader might have cause to wonder if he is reading the wrong book. Fortunately, these little detours are not only interesting but help us see Lincoln and the Civil War period from a new perspective.I found this short book (about 200 pages) to be interesting and engaging. It was written by an author who understands how to communicate and keep the reader's interest. I would recommend it to anyone having an interest in Lincoln or the Civil War."

The collection, periodically updated and reprinted, hold up pretty well as an antidote to Lincoln the myth, offering instead Lincoln the man of flesh and blood.Many of the myths with which Donald does battle are still prevalent, and his thoughtful essays provide insight and context on a remarkable man, raised on the American frontier and largely self-made, who became a successful lawyer, politician, and wartime president. Donald discusses Lincoln's background, education, his Whig politican background, and the adroit way in which he managed his administration during the Civil War. Among the touchy issues are Lincoln's handling of the Emancipation Proclomation and his selective curbing of civil war during the rebellion. Donald acknowledges many contradictions, but offers some pathways to understanding a complex man whose life has been distorted by both historians and more recent politicians; highly recommended to students of Lincoln and of the Civil War."

This takes a bit of time and expands on it very nicely. It starts out with a nice introdution about Lincoln and his times, the people he knew and worked with, then goes onto the politics and war. It had some anecdotes that you never see anywhere else. It turns out that Linoln was not a rabid emancipationist, but a pratical president who did things as needed to be done. I wondered before why he only freed the slaves in the states in rebellion: it was because he did not want to alienate the slaveholders in Kentucky and Maryland. I am still mystified as to the reason for the war of northern aggression: slavery does not seem to be the all inclusive answer that mythology makes it out to be, and this book shows some altenative reasons, but does not take a stand, after it is only a collection of essays."

1221,B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,A2X016MRJ0XVT6,David J. Heinrich,9/16,5.0,1072224000,The criticisms of this book are flawed,"Rather than explaining why this is a good book (other revierw's do that), I'll explain why some of the idiotic criticisms levied against this book are wrong.The most silly criticism of Hazlitt (and other Austrian free-market economists) is that they aren't &quot;scientific&quot; and in short &quot;don't use enough math&quot;. This is an absurd criticism. Firstly, human beings are not deterministic particles who's behaviour can be predicted by simple equations. Any attempt to reduce human behaviour to some mathematical equation is pure non-sense. We must consider human beings as individual entities who can choose, not fixed constants in mathematical formuli.Secondly, there is a mathematics that is relevant to Austrians. It is chaos theory and network theory. Chaos theory is currently used to predict the weather. The calculus used by Keynes and other idiots like him is completely useless for describing the behaviour of chaotic systems where individual choice is involved. Hazlitt may not mention Chaos Theory. For that, see Murray N. Rothbard, &quot;Choas Theory: Destroying Mathematics from Within?&quot;; and Gene Callahan, &quot;Why Austrians Should Care About Network Science&quot;. Anyone with any sympathy for Keynes and his idiotic followers should note that Keynes put forth a &quot;treatise&quot; before General Theory, which was demolished by Hayek. Hayek then made a strategical mistake in not demolishing General Theory, feeling that the book's idiocy stood for itself. Also note that while Hayek recieved a Nobel Prize for work which was basically an extension of Mises business cycle theory (Mises died the year before Hayek's Nobel), Keynes received no Nobel, showing that even the dimwits awarding that title realized Keynes work was inherently worthless.The next criticism is related to the first: that Hazlitt doesn't discuss game theory. The reason for this is that game theory is particularly unworthy of discussion. Nash, founder of Game Theory, showed that in any finite game, there's an equilibrium in which no player can improve his or her outcome given the other player's strategies (the Nash Equilibrium). This is problematic in several ways. Firstly, there is absolutely no relation between the playing of games (which are less than net-zero, with one winner and one or more losers) and economics. Secondly, only Game Therorists behave in real situations in the ways in which Game Theory predicts. Thirdly, strategies are not data, but choices. Fourth, it is possible to break out of the specified game to achieve a superior result.One particularly ignorant reviewer says that in a completely unhampered free market, monopolies form, destroying competition. This is non-sense. Empirically, Ancient Ireland was a completely Stateless society for a thousand years, with a completely unhampered free market, and no-such thing occured. And of course it is a bunch of non-sense that can't happen in reality anyeways. A monopoly is only harmful if you have monopoly prices. But in a completely free market, even if someone obtains 100% of all (say) rail-roads, there is still competition between that form of transportation and other forms, thus monopoly prices cannot be charged. The only time real monopolies with monopoly pricing have emerged is because of State interference.This may not be the best book on economics that you can read (look to Mises' &quot;Human Action&quot; for what is most likely the strongest treatise on &quot;economics&quot; [actually praxeology, a much larger field]) ever written."

People want to know what went wrong. As Guy Sorman concludes in his marvelous book,Economics Does Not Lie: A Defense of the Free Market in a Time of Crisis, what went wrong is the ill-advised government intervention---not just in America, but globally. Governments rarely get it right when they try to intervene; their short-term fixes usually have long-term negative ramifications.The free market economy is what lured Russia into ending the Cold War twenty years ago. It helped 800 million Chinese greatly improve their economic well-being, as well.

The ""one lesson"" is broad enough that it covers pretty much any topic in economics, so the author is free to discuss a long list of subjects and applications.Despite being written decades ago, this book is (unfortunately) very timely. The blowout government spending of the last few years shows clearly that our society has forgotten much, perhaps most, of how economics works.The only drawback to the book is that its title implies it covers all of economics. I had expected a one-book summary of the entire science (micro to macro).Instead, the book's primary focus is on how government actions affect the economy. Granted, our government today interferes in almost every sector of the economy, so this makes the book more broadly relevant than the author probably would have liked.Still, the basics of micro economics are not really covered here.

The ideas are still pertinent, but many examples are not as relevant today.2) I'm afraid that reading Naked Economics first spoiled me a bit. This book lacked the humor and pep that kept me engrossed in the former.3) Most importantly, the book is strictly about economics, and is too simplistic in some ways. It fails to incorporate the complex real world political dynamics that determine policy. Today, most congressmen are sold on the benefits of free trade. But the barriers to economic growth are more nuanced in the real world.Some will argue that this was not the focus of the book, and they are correct. Still, I fear that a reader will latch onto Hazlitt's ideas as a panacea, and fail to appreciate that in a world where ""Keeping up with the Joneses"" is as important, if not more important, than how much wealth one has, that policy decisions are more complex that the author would have us believe."

But on let us not get too easily carried away by this author's reduction.The global markets of our age are, after all, dominated by the great (and institutionally amoral) transnational corporations we've been effectively forced to know so well.

It is well written, succinct and, in places, an accurate exegesis of free market economics. In much of the text, Hazlitt artfully debunks incorrect reasoning that often drives economic policy. Insofar as the book limits itself to that modest goal, it succeeds admirably. But when Hazlett more ambitiously attempts to purvey free market economics as singular truth the book falls painfully short.Hazlitt, like other free market economists, forgets that free market theory is only a pardigm. Free market thinking is useful to the extent that the conditions precedent to a free market are fulfilled; but no further. When the assumptions underlying free market thought are not met, the theory may fail. And in virtually ignoring this fact the book founders.For example, Hazlitt never mentions the problem of externalities which free markets inevitably fail to address. And his actors always conform to behavior convenient for free market theory. To paraphrase Garrison Keillor, Hazlett's universe is a paradise where all the markets are strong, all the investments are attractive and all the profits are above average.But there are other failings, too. The dislocations of a free market economy are generally trivialized. Unemployment is almost viewed as a benefit to workers when resultant from free market operations; as if a pink slip were a toll pass for the Yellow Brick Road leading to the Oz of more efficient employment. In several places Hazlitt is inconsistent, as when discussing the failure of marginal producers (a benefit when caused by free market processes in declining industries; an evil when caused by ""excessive"" wage demands by labor). Remarkably, he adverts to the ""inappropriate"" political power wielded by labor and farmers due to their disproportionate numbers, while never mentioning the truly undue influence that corporate largesse has on governing institutions. What Hazlett considers improper political influence most of us would consider functioning democracy.In summary, this book is a useful and brief introduction to free market economics. So long as one recognizes its limitations, well . . .no harm, no foul. But for true economic enlightenment you will have to look elsewhere."

He uses a story form to educate the readers on the problems with typically inflicted governmental action in about 25 areas including the following: government 'make work' projects, taxes, credit, machinery, reductions in numbers of government employees, tariffs, price fixing, subsidizing commodities, rent control, minimum wage laws, unions, profits, and attacks on savings.As politicians around the world, including the United States, regularly make harmful errors in their attempts to buy votes, this should be required reading for all of them, as well as college economics professors who are so enamoured with Keynes and Marx.Hazlitt does a great job in making the case that, prior to taking action on economic issues, decision makers should look at the effect on everyone involved (not just the groups that they are trying to seduce into voting for them) as well as the long range implications of the policy.Readers should come away from reading this with a clear understanding of the marvels of a free market (if we were ever allowed to have one) and the incredibly damaging effects of governmental manipulations of the economy.

If everyone were able to force their employer to pay what they consider ""just"" ($50/hour for stocking groceries sounds nice,) every business would fail rather swiftly. I usually hear that all businessmen are evil and they will always seek to ""exploit"" the labor force by paying an ""unfair wage."" I think if this were the case everyone would be making minimum wage. Businesses have to compete to attract employees and offering higher wages is the way to accomplish that. So why implement a minimum wage in the first place? I'm sure it is seen as a solution to help the poor, obviously if businessmen were forced to give more money for labor those working would be better off right?First lets see what happens to the business. The cost of production has been raised and I feel inclined to say that business will raise prices though this usually wouldn't be the case. Most prices are already at a point where if you lower them the firm wouldn't be making a profit and if you raise prices demand will fall to a point where you also wouldn't be making a profit. The only other solution is to lower cost of production. This will lead to the unemployment of those whose productivity doesn't justify such a high wage. In the case of where I work no one was immediately laid off but as people quit here and there others were not hired in their stead. Basically if you working a low-skilled job and the government arbitrarily forces your employer to pay you more, you could very well be out of a job all-together. So actually yes, those who are left working would be better off but it will be at the expense of those who have lost their jobs. Which is better $2/hr. or $0/hr? Minimum wage creates unemployment which hurts the poorest the worst.Or heres a simple one, economic stimulus. Can government stimulate growth in an economy? What if government spends billions of dollars on projects they deem appropriate? I think on the face of it economic stimulus makes no sense simply because all funds going into the economy necessarily had to come from the economy. Even when you print money for these purposes you will eventually have to pay for them in the form of inflation. Not to mention whatever the government decides as an appropriate project will have to be contrary to what consumers actually want considering the force required to carry out these plans.I highly recommend this book, even if you are a layman don't be discouraged by the word ""economics."" I would consider myself very simple and I feel I grasped this whole capitalism concept pretty well. I can't stress enough the importance of the private ownership over the means of production, the market forces businesses to serve our needs, government will only join up with the wealthy and double-team our poor little behinds. Peace!"

This has probably never been truer today. People who can explain how economics work in a simple way are rare. Henry Hazlitt is one of few. This book was first written in 1946, a time when his views were unfashionable (John Maynard Keynes was the role model at this time), and it was slightly updated in 1979 when his opinions were back in vogue. Hazlitt is a hero in libertarian circles, both in the past with friends like Ayn Rand, Friedrich von Hayek and Milton Friedman, and right now with praise from Ron Paul and Steve Forbes. However, I don't think you have to be a libertarian or a conservative to appreciate this book. Over 1 million copies have been sold so far.The book's subtitle is ""The Shortest And Surest Way To Understand Basic Economics"" which probably is true, especially if you politically have more conservative views. The book opens strongly with part one ""The Lesson"", which on eight pages explains the basics, which actually is enough to read. Then that is applied on various topics like why there is no net benefit to the economy from broken windows or wars, plus several chapters on why less government is better than more.This must be one of the easiest books to read in the field of economics. Very simple language and complex issues are dealt with head on. They are beautifully explained. The text is a pleasure to read, and an entertaining read too, since you tend to side with the author against everyone else, who doesn't seem to understand anything.The battle among economists (say the Austrian school against the Keynesian), politicians (Tea Party against Obama) or countries (like Germany against PIIGS) is as fierce as it has ever been. It's been an on-going battle since the gold standard fell out of favour during the 1930's. The topics of the current debate in Europe, Japan and the US are the same. More or less government intervention, more or less/no QE etc. My favourite chapter is part three, which was added in 1979, which has the title ""The Lesson After Thirty Years"". His conclusion then was that politicians had learnt nothing. The policies he had warned for in 1946 had been implemented by politicians and the western world was now suffering because of that. He focused specifically on the topic of the decade, inflation. He viewed it as an effect of a big increase in government spending, big government deficits and the big increase in stock of money.His discussion around this problem feels very current. Despite that everything had gone against him over those 30 years, and that he concludes that the outlook is dark he manages to find some hope. That hope was that he felt that the ""Keynesians"" and the ""New Dealers"" were in retreat, and that the conservatives, libertarians and the defenders of free enterprise were more outspoken. That hope actually proved to be right, in the sense that inflation was killed. However, I highly doubt that he in his wildest dreams would have guessed what actually happened over the following decades and that he would have been very unhappy with the current situation. Still, just as in 1979, I guess he would have seen some hope in the debate.In part one he has even narrowed down his lesson, to one sentence ""The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists of tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups"".Mr Hazlitt died in 1993 (98 years old). If not, I would have looked forward to an update, a chapter four - The Lesson after 64 years.This is a review by eqtbooks.com"

I say this only to indicate that I have some degree of knowledge of the subject matter at hand. Despite studying close to 3 years of economics, Henry Hazlitt's magnificent work, Economics in One Lesson, is still a valuable resource. Even Keynesian economists will find something of value in this legendary introduction to Austrian economics. Whether you are a layman or a college educated economist, I'm sure this classic work will be of some worth to you.Positive Aspects:1) Hazlitt is an excellent writer. I can not imagine an economics book that is more clearly and concisely written.2) Hazlitt is, for the most part, absolutely correct. Despite what you hear in modern media, government intervention is, in general, harmful to the economy as a whole.3) The chapters are short. Anyone can sit down for a few minutes, read a chapter or two, and gain some knowledge relevant to economic discourse.4) Compared with other works on economics, this book is something of a page-turner. You won't be bored to death trying to deal with complicated mathematics of graphs.5) A wide variety of topics concerning government intervention in the economy are covered. Amazingly, nearly the entire book is relevant to modern discussions.Negative Aspects:1) Some of the arguments in Hazlitt's work are simply too brief. His reasoning doesn't always feel fully fleshed out, nor is he always charitable to the opposing viewpoint.In conclusion, I feel Hazlitt's book is somewhat impossible to summarize. I will attempt to do my best. Anyone who is even somewhat interested in economics will benefit from reading this book, whether or not they agree with the author's conclusions. It is a classic economics introduction for a reason, after all. I would recommend this work to anyone who has even a passing interest in economics. Don't take my word for it, though; buy this book, and let Hazlitt speak to you."

And economics books are usually full of a bunch of boring formulas. In college, I read two of these super boring economics textbooks, and I really didn't learn very much about economics. After college, I read this book, and I learned about twice as much by reading this book, than by going through my two boring college economics classes.This book is so easy to read. It has really interesting examples, like what's the economic benefit or detriment to an economy, if a thug tosses a brick through a shopkeeper's store window? The broken window will create jobs for the people who make new glass windows, but what does this do to the economy as a whole? Even though the book centers on this example, and examples really similar to this, it covers tons of different topics in economics.Everyone should read this book! Economics is a very important subject, and it can be really hard to get into an economics book long enough to actually learn anything. This book is totally great for a first time introduction to economics, and it's a great way of looking at things differently even if you know a lot about it.I've read the print book years ago, and I just listened to the audible edition. Both are excellent, and it was a great book to read again.Pros:+The quickest way to get you up to speed on the subject of economics+If you're interested in politics at all, you really should read this book+It might be the only readable book about economics out there, and economics is a really important subject+Still fascinating after over 70 years+Audio book reader was greatCons:-It was originally published in 1946, and then updated in 1978. So, even this most recent version is over thirty years old, so it's written in a little older language with dated examples, but for what it is, it's very good-It's a little harsh, just like all economics books are, about small groups of people who should lose their jobs so that more people can have jobs in the long run. I'd recommend a few sections on how we can help these people transition, but then that would probably make this book really long."

It teaches basic, self-evident principles that form the foundation for logical economic thought.'Economics in One Lesson' should have perhaps been titled, 'Economic Policy in One Lesson', because Hazlitt is mainly concerned here with the effects of government policy on the market:""...The whole of economics can be reduced to a single lesson, and that lesson can be reduced to a single sentence: The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.""Hazlitt's theorem is that much of our economic thought and government policy is based on fallacy. His method is to show an example of bad economic policy, explain how it adversely affects the market, and then teach good policy using logical reasoning. Along those lines, the book does not address basics such as supply and demand, but rather tackles questions like, ""What is the effect of government credit on production?"" Nonetheless, an absolute beginner should be able to understand the concepts presented here, even though the finer points may be lost. After reading this work, you will be able to analyze and evaluate economic policy and reason about its effects on the market.Pay no heed to those that accuse Hazlitt of taking a narrow-minded, Libertarian viewpoint. Regardless of your economic/political affiliations, the truths presented in this book are so self-evident that, in my opinion, they are defensible on common sense alone and demonstrated throughout history."

1254,B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,A2AKT5NNBA4MOU,"Robert W. Weeks ""Bob""",6/7,5.0,1213056000,"If you read only one economics book, read this","This book, first published in 1946, explains common fallacies (a false or mistaken idea) that are particularly common in the field of economics and public policy. At the very start of the book Mr. Hazlitt explains:Economics is haunted by more fallacies than any other study known to man. This is no accident. The inherent difficulties of the subject would be great enough in any case, but they are multiplied a thousandfold by a factor that is insignificant in, say, physics, mathematics or medicine -- the special pleading of selfish interests. While every group has certain economic interests identical with those of all groups, every group has also, as we shall see, interests antagonistic to those of all other groups. While certain public policies would in the long run benefit everybody, other policies would benefit one group only at the expense of all other groups. The group that would benefit by such policies, having such a direct interest in them, will argue for then plausibly and persistently. It will hire the best buyable minds to devote their whole time to presenting its case. And it will finally either convince the general public that its case is sound, or so befuddle it that clear thinking on the subject becomes next to impossible.In addition to these endless pleadings of self-interest, there is a second main factor that spawns new economic fallacies every day. This is the persistent tendency of men to see only the immediate effects of a given policy, or its effects only on a special group, and to neglect to inquire what the long-run effects of that policy will be not only on that special group but on all groups. It is the fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences.At first it seems as though not much has changed since the end of World War II. What has changed, though, is the scope of the dangers Mr. Hazlitt identifies. That's because government is much expanded and more assertive today than when this book was written. In 1946 the New Deal was not very old, and the tremendous expansion of government social programs was still in the future. We should take these lessons as even more important today.It is the overlooked consequences that cause harm. They are overlooked sometimes because they are difficult to see, as in the broken window fallacy explained by Frederic Bastiat and also in this book. They are also ""overlooked"" because, as Mr. Hazlitt tells us, one group wants special favors from the government, and although there is no way to grant these favors without harming some other group, the favor-seeking group will seek to hide, obfuscate, muddle, or minimize the bad effects. At the same time they promote the policy as good for everyone. This is largely the job that lobbyists perform, and billions are spent on it each year. That's because a powerful government has the ability to bestow valuable favors, those favors being paid for by someone else, someone often not easily seen.An example of overlooked secondary consequences is government spending. When government spends, it means it must tax or borrow. What government spends is not available for individuals to spend. When we see magnificent public works (say a new downtown arena in Wichita), we don't see all the things that would have been bought had the government not taxed to build the public work. We see the jobs created by the public work -- all the construction workers that will be building the new arena -- but we don't see the jobs destroyed because people had to reduce their spending elsewhere.Foreign trade is a case where people often fail to grasp the complete picture. We often see exports as something good for our economy, while imports are seen as bad. Imported things are things that American workers can't compete with, and so American jobs are lost, it is often said. But as Mr. Hazlitt says: ""It is exports that pay for imports. The greater exports we have, the greater imports we must have, if we ever expect to get paid. The smaller imports we have, the smaller exports we can have. Without imports we can have no exports, for foreigners will have to funds with which to buy our goods."" So those wanting restrictions on imports are also -- although they do not say this, either because they do not recognize it or it doesn't matter to them -- calling for fewer exports.In recent years we have been told that our is a ""consumer-driven"" economy, fueled by people tapping their home equity that accumulated from increased home values, or spending by going into debt. It is as though if consumers started saving rather then spending on immediate consumption, the American economy would collapse. But Mr. Hazlitt tells us that ""saving is only another form of spending."" After all, what is done with money that is saved? Today, few put their savings under the mattress. Instead, it is loaned to a bank or invested. Then it is spent on capital goods, which businesses use to increase their productive capability. The key fact is that businesses spend it. And, they spend it on capital goods that either expand their capacity to produce, or decease their present costs of production. Either way, that is good for everyone. It means more jobs, and better jobs. But this saving is derided as not being ""productive.""As a conclusion Mr. Hazlitt tells us:And this is our lesson in its most generalized form. For many things that seem to be true when we concentrate on a single economic group are seen to be illusions when the interests of everyone, as consumer no less than producer, are considered.To see the problem as a whole, and not in fragments: that is the goal of economic science.This is a very valuable book, which while dated a bit, cuts through the fog and haze of economics and public policy and lets us understand the effects of our government's policies."

And if they've already read it...they should read it again, because I think quite a few of them need to be reminded of some simple truths.I am a graduate economics student and I have trudged through extremely technical economic literature in my time. Most leading economists these days become hyperspecialized and esoteric in some paltry technical issue to the point where their work is practically useless to the average person. This is a very terrible thing. Because knowledge of economics is so crucially important to our understanding of human behavior and the world, I think it *should* be accessible to more people. For this reason, I am always on the lookout for books that help people understand economics easily. That way, we can have a much better world.I have found few books better for the beginner than _Economics in One Lesson_. Henry Hazlitt's book here is very highly regarded and for good reason: it's an excellent, simple look at economic issues that teaches an important lesson. That lesson? That good economics entails looking at the long-term effects of economic policies on *everyone*, rather than the short-term effects on one group. With this, we can see that when the government intervenes in the economy, there are always consequences that not immediately evident.Although the book was originally published in 1946, the topics covered by Hazlitt are pertinent and explore issues that still confront us more than 50 years later. Topics include inflation, tariffs, taxation, price fixing, labor unions, savings, the importance of profits, rent control, and more. Hazlitt writes well and doesn't obfuscate the truths of matters with cumbersome graphs and math.Please ignore James McDuffie's fatuous review. Most of the ""implicit assumptions"" Hazlitt makes are unassailable facts of reality established a priori. (Except for the assumption that government can be the *only* provider of some services, like roads, ""health officers,"" police, etc.) Also, mathematics is all but useless in economics. The Keynesian paradigm no longer deserves any serious attention since it has been so thoroughly refuted a hundred thousand times over. Inflation as being beneficial to the economy is a fallacy that is easily destroyed by someone with a basic knowledge of money & credit theory. Alan Greenspan a free market proponent? That's ridiculous -- he definitely was 40 years ago but he has since become anathema to the economic prosperity. In fact he's probably the most destructive Federal Reserve Chairman in history.Pick up this book and Gene Callahan's _Economics for Real People_ and you'll probably have a better economic education than you will find with any undergraduate degree in neoclassical economics.

He doesn't advocate the elimination of all levels of government in the economy, only those that are undeniably counter- productive and even destructive. He definitely would not get along very well with Keynesian economists.I like the examples that Hazlitt uses in this book, because they make it very easy to understand exactly what he is talking about. This is very helpful to readers who may not have much understanding of economics.Hazlitt avoids talking about statistics and he doesn't utilize graphic illustrations. I think some graphs would have been helpful, because it makes the points easy to visualize. But I think the reason that Hazlitt avoids graphs and statistics is because he wanted this book to be timeless. True, the book has undergone several revisions over the years, but the basic information and the debunking of economic myths that held true 50 years ago still hold true today.Another thing that makes this book and easy one to read is the way Hazlitt divides the book into so many short chapters. The total length of this book is only 214 pages, yet it includes 26 chapters. That makes each chapter only about 8 pages in length, on average. Some are very short, like chapter 2 (the one on the broken window) which is only 2 pages in length. Keep in mind that Hazlitt didn't intend this book to be an argumentative analysis on the pros and cons of government intervention. He only meant to show the reader exactly what happens, when government sticks its ugly head into areas where it doesn't belong, and how these actions are detrimental to the overall economy over time. They might seem helpful in the short run, but they are destructive in the long run.If there is one lesson that Hazlitt tries to drive home in this book, it's the tendency of people to be short- sighted when they evaluate the ramifications of government involvement in the economy; and the almost universal tendency to only see one side of the issue. For example, with tariffs, we are all fooled by politicians into supporting them because we think about the jobs that will be saved. We don't even think about the higher prices that will result from the tariff, which must be borne by the people who purchase the product. We don't think about the jobs that will be lost by other industries that would have received our extra money, had we not been forced to pay the higher price that the tariff resulted in. We see the trees, but not the forest.Overall, this is a good book to read by anyone who would like to see these common economic myths proven wrong. Don't be misled by the book's title. This is not a basic economic theory book. It's a book about the negative effects of government intervention in the economy, and it does an effective job in exposing these myths."

Fallacious economic policies almost invariably seek to benefit one group at the expense of all others, or to bring about short-term benefits at the expense of long-term benefits. With this as his thesis, Hazlitt examines the numerous manifestations of such fallacies in different situations.His chapters are short, his prose is easy to follow, and his logic is compelling. I've never taken an economics class in my life, yet I had no trouble following the reasoning in this book. This is a must read for anyone who wants to understand basic economics and the keys to widespread prosperity in the long run."

That's why they tend to believe whatever they see and hear on their televisions. By reading this short book, you'll gain a basic understanding of economics, and an explanation of the many myths that are taken as truths.In the final chapter of this book, Hazlitt revists his work 30 years later (he was writing in 1978, and the book came out originally in 1946). He surmises that during that period, nothing was learned. If anything, he says, subjects related in the book (wage rates, price controls, government ""make work"") have become more political. I wonder what Hazlitt would say now.You need to read this book in order to appreciate the real consequences of actions your government wants to take. The theme emphasized over and over in the book is that actions must be thought through to see what the long term effects will be, not just the highly visible short term ones."

Clark,44/47,5.0,1251849600,A life-changing (or at least mind-changing) book,"I read this book as a college grad fairly ignorant of economic matters. It completely changed my world view. Perhaps that sounds hyperbolic, but the common-sense lessons about human thought and action in this small, easily digestible book have materialized in virtually every aspect of my life, from the obvious, such as my views on political policy, to the obscure, such as my relationships and my satisfaction with my own choices. Hazlitt is never heavy-handed; he comes over as extremely objective because he doesn't need to convince anyone of his views. He is confident that anyone who takes the time to read, consider, and understand true economics would be hard-pressed to reject the logical conclusions he offers.The book essentially springs from the premise that economic fallacy results from considering the effects of a policy or action only on a specific group or over a short period of time. From this he goes on to explain how such fallacies have invaded every single sphere of public policy. While before I vaguely opposed the idea of public works projects, tariffs, and welfare, I had no reasoning to back up my thoughts so I rarely expressed them. Hazlitt's book, instead of arming me with political doublespeak, provided me with the solid theory to truly understand why things that seem hard to argue against--kickbacks for hardworking but suffering farmers, for example-- are really counter productive. I recommend this book for people who hail from any economic class or political party; it won't offend you, and will do nothing but make you more informed and better equipped to understand the world around you."

Less a primer in economics than a concise debunking of crank positions on economic issues, this book can clear the air (and the mind) quickly after some interested sophist plumps for a discredited idea. Hazlitt's parable of the broken window, meant to show how what dosen't happen as a result of human action is at least as important as what does, is the best introduction to economic theory for the average reader since Adam Smith. The visible results that people see as a result of government intervention in the market must be weighed against what did not come to pass because of the reallocation of resources (i.e., your hard-earned money) that such action necesitates. This book is timeless, in that it is not tied to concrete examples drawn from the headlines of 1946, and is also remarkably free of venom , passion, or spite, which too often mar polemical works on economics - and serve to camouflage bad reasoning. This book can be a basic education in itself, or the beginning of deeper study, in the works of Von Mises, Von Hayek, Schumpeter, or of Hazlett himself.

Macleod ""pnmacleod""",26/31,4.0,1053129600,"Great Book, but Where is the MISSING CHAPTER?","This is an excellent book that is easy to follow and understand. The one lesson is very simple: explore all the consequences of policies and actions, including not only short-term and long-term consequences, but also what actions cannot be done as a consequence of a initial policy or action (e.g. If you spend money on A, you cannot spend the same money on B -- or another way of saying you cannot eat your cake and have it too). Basically, the lesson is to be thorough in analysis of actions and policies. Mr. Hazlitt applies this lesson to a series of economic issues.It should be noted that many of the ideas in the book come from an 1850 essay by Frederick Bastiat, ""What is Seen and What is Unseen"".Using his lesson of thorough analysis, Mr. Hazlitt illustrates of how rent-control can lead to housing shortages, minimum-wage laws can lead to fewer jobs, and tariffs can lead to higher consumer prices. What is SEEN is the benefit to a special group (those in rent-controlled apartments, those with the jobs, or those receiving the protection of the tariff), but what is UNSEEN is the harm done to other groups (those that don't get the benefit of new housing, those who don't get jobs, and those who have to pay higher prices).My criticism of the book is that there is an ENORMOUS OMISSION. After examining so many topics, Mr. Hazlitt fails to even bring up the government intervention that has had the greatest impact on our economic and political lives (for good and evil), the CORPORATION. Corporations are the biggest influences in our political campaigns, the recipients of the many of the benefits of tariffs and subsidies, and are the focus of many of the regulations of our government.Mr. Hazlitt's book at least gives us the tools to look at the issue of the corporation.Corporations have three qualities that are different from other business types: limited liability, personhood, and the perpetual life. I will get you started with the analysis of limited liability.Limited liability means that an owner or stockholder cannot lose than he or she has paid for the shares of ownership regardless of the firm's debts.Limited liability cannot be created by a free-market. What is SEEN is that limited liability shields investors from risk, but what is UNSEEN is that the risk is transferred to the other parties, or stakeholders. To some of the stakeholders the acceptance of the risk is an implied contract; employees, creditors, suppliers and customers should aware that by doing business with a corporation they are taking on the risk of the results of actions done in the names of the owners (most corporation special-interest advocates label this government intervention as ""efficiency""). However, there is no implied contract with third parties (tort victims). If a corporation goes out of business owing money to third parties no one is held responsible, not owners, not managers. Limited Liability is government granted limited responsibility, or legalized irresponsibility. Government has transferred risks, and the associated costs without the associated benefits, to third parties.I urge all readers to use Mr. Hazlitt's method to answer, at least, the questions below.What are the short-term and long-term impacts of Limited Liability on each stakeholder -- investors, managers, employees, suppliers, creditors, and THIRD PARTIES (tort victims), competitors, citizens etc...? What is the impact on competition? How does limited liability change financial markets? How does limited liability relate to the size of organizations? What are the implications of limited liability to the different types of market failures such as Moral Hazard, Rent Seeking, and Market Control? What are the implications for the Principle-Agent problem? What do the large resources gained by means of limited liability mean in a court case where a corporation in matched against a tort victim or any individual? How does all this relate to problems like Superfund sites and asbestos claims? In general, who are the special interest groups that benefit and how do they emphasize the benefits of limited liability without mentioning the costs? In general, who are the groups that are hurt?Now, what are the implications of corporate personhood?There are a few other shortcomings in the book, but still it is a great exercise in thinking through ideas.Cheers."

Libertarian economics is quite sensible stuff, though there are a couple of interesting ansatzes that are quite false.The main bad idea is that the market is rational. A free market does not choose the best price via the laws of supply and demand. While supply and demand factor in, cartels, monopolies, advertising, irrational exuberance, war, quasi-religious crazes (c.f. cabbage patch dolls or whatever kids toy people go wild for now a days) all factor into prices. This isn't idle theorizing on my part: I make my living on this fact.Another falsehood is that governmentally funded projects are somehow inherently evil. The author goes to great lengths to ""prove"" this. I find it absurd (though, to be fair, I have worked for a governmentally funded project). Virtually all scientific and technological progress since the 1940s has been the result of a governmentally funded project. Most infrastructure since the 1930s; dams, bridges, highways has been a result of same. I can't argue much with his assertion that various ham-handed governmental interferences with the economy (price-fixing, industry bail-outs, etc) are silly and rarely work. Those have generally been disasters. But, for example, microchips and the internet seem to be pretty useful. Perhaps it wasn't as easy to see this in Hazlitt's era.

I mean... libertarians speak as though the game is over and they have ""won"" in that the correctness of their theory has been fully confirmed.The ancient Greeks during the period of the Athenian empire were the proponents of the most archetypal (and one of the earliest) forms of democracy. Imagine if, after the Peloponnesian war and the fall of the Athenian empire to a Spartan puppet state, someone had declared that democracy was a failed experiment! The course of history certainly does not bear out that presumption. I hear echoes of this sentiment among the hard-line right wing, who speak as though the entire course of human history has culminated in modern times and has now been vindicated in the form of democracy.The socialists don't fare any better. The arguments against them are grounded in such common sense and indisputable fact that they scarcely need to be listed. People like to own stuff. Plus, J. M. Keynes still owes me $2... the cheapskate.The fact is that socialism is an inevitability in a world where the ever-increasing world population renders individual choice more and more meaningless. As powerful as a relatively few individuals may become, those few will always depend on the masses more than vice versa.Marx and Engels foolishly sought to bypass the democratic/free-enterprise/industrial step in economic development, and in so doing rendered their brand of socialism ineffective and that school of thinking has taken on an air of anachronism. You can't side-step the aformentioned phase in socio-economic development any more than you can side-step learning to add before attempting to multiply! Before the proletariat has any reason to overtake the plutocratic ""haves"", they must be beaten down and humiliated for generations.I am personally neither a socialist or libertarian. I am an observer who tends to shy away from systematic doctrine simply because it is useless in explaining such ineffable phenomena as human choice and behaviour. I respect those economists who embrace the chaotic nature of such phenomena and attempt to use them to their advantage.I just ordered this book from Amazon, and I can't wait to read it!

McDuffie,10/39,3.0,1054944000,Unconvinced and unimpressed,"Hazlitt analyzes the broken window fallacy as applied to everyday economics and economic policy. The basic idea of analyzing the consequences of economic policymaking on every group in society instead of just certain special interest groups is sound. But there is much more to this book than that. The Keynesians are decried and the book is essentially a tribute to laissez faire capitalism. This is fine except like Von Mises and the rest of the crowd there are implicit assumptions which are never addressed on every page. That is the basic problem with the deductive approach to economics: it is not deductive. Nobody ever points out that Hazlitt assumes virtually every curve in economics is linear or at best only very slightly nonlinear. That simple assumption despite what Hazlitt says is critical. The shape of these curves probably change over time and are deeply related to whether the ""free market"" or Keynesians are mostly correct. I suspect very strongly that which is best changes over time and that extremes either way are detrimental to the population and government. It has always been fascinating to me that although a large free market school has developed over time none of them appear to do any real mathematical or economic analysis ( If they did they would understand what a bunch of hooeey much of the content of this book and others is.) and that one notable free market proponent i.e. Greenspan may be getting ready to do a very Keynesian thing to the economy. In the long run objectivism and laissez faire capitalism have become interwined and confused over time and suffer from the same problems. I am not a government controls proponent. I have the same problem with the government intervention policies: it is essentially knob-twiddling and I have a congenital disorder which causes my rear end to seize up whenever the knob-twiddlers start up. It would be different if they actually knew what they were doing but even the stupid realize that they really don't and even Greenspan freely admits as much. Nor am I Keynesian in outlook. I noticed recently they are trying to justify themselves in textbooks by pointing out that inflation may not really cause much damage to the public and that what actually causes the damage are some of the things that occurred concurrently with inflation in the past. There oughta be a law against this kind of tripe. Inflating the economy just for the fun of it has caused all kinds of damage this century. There may be times when inflating the economy a little may be the way to proceed. But the hyperinflation of the 1965 - 1985 timeframe did many people in the population a great deal of harm and yes much of it was due to phenomenon which accompanied inflation instead of the inflation itself. But that may be the character of inflation. Many of the neo-Keynesians were in diapers during this time and the record is not as objective as a scientist would like. The truth lies somewhere out there at any given time and I suspect that economists that are not too tightly glued to any one school of thought are the most likely to find it.

This is an awesome book for any reader.This book was not at all what I expected when I ordered it. I expected a textbook like approach to all the classic concepts of economics (supply/demand curves, law of diminishing returns, effects of shortages/gluts on prices, etc.) Instead, Hazlitt simply states that true economics involves tracing both the seen and unseen consequences of each action or policy. This is primarily a book about government policy in economics, but it scope reaches to every choice we make with regard to the economic well-being of our nation.I had many 'Ah ha!' moments while reading this book. I felt I had a fairly good grasp on many economic prinicples after reading Skousen's 'The Making of Modern Economics', but Hazlitt has a way of crystalizing thoughts that are still fuzzy. One thing that comes through consistently is how money confuses and distracts people from a true understanding of wealth. Money is not wealth. True physical wealth lies in the products (goods and services) you have or can afford to buy. The wealth of a nation lies in the aggregate products it produces. If you want economic prosperity, increase production. Not senseless production, but production of things people actually want. When all is said and done, money is just the &quot;medium of exchange&quot;. Ultimately, all products are paid for by other products.Despite my high regard for this book, at times it dragged. Many topics are similar, and it seemed at times repetitive to go over the same ground again.I wish every American (especially politicians and aspiring politicians) would read this book."

Smyth ""EyeLean5280""",11/16,4.0,1262822400,"Very Good, But Be Aware of What You're Getting","This is an edited version of a review that I'd previously removed. People didn't feel the first version was helpful, a fact which I suspect to be due to two possibilities, depending upon the individuals involved. For one thing, it was very long. For another, although it praised Halzitt on many points, it was not an obeisant psalm that accepted without question every single thing he asserted (this was the problem for one highly emotional commentator).So out of sensitivity to the preciousness of readers' time, I offer a shorter version. I am, however, still a skeptic and agnostic when it comes to economic schools of thought, so if you worship at the alter of Smith (or even Marx, Keynes, or indeed, any of the august minds that have turned their hand to this soft science), I'm afraid this review will not be for you.Economics In One Lesson (written in 1946, re-published with some updating in 1978) was intended as a layman's introduction to free-market arguments against the continuation of New Deal policies in the postwar era. Halzitt writes beautifully, always respecting the intelligence of the reader. He neither inundates with professional jargon nor clutters up the pages with tons of tables and graphs. He explains and illustrates thoroughly yet not exhaustively. The result is a highly approachable work that has remained popular for decades.Hazlitt's arguments are cogent and it is easy to find plenty of merit in them. However, they are often strongest where they are obsolete. His descriptions of how credit works are downright touching in their quaintness (think: the Bailey Building and Loan in ""It's a Wonderful Life""). In EIOL, there is nothing resembling the kinds of byzantine credit shenanigans which have caused so much trouble of late.Another weakness of the book is that many of the claims made in the original were not re-visited in 1978. Halzitt complained in '46, for example, that the GI Bill was extending credit hither and yon without the tough standards necessary to protect the investment. Halzitt failed to add a footnote in the '78 version letting us know how his dire predictions of mass default turned out. Readers are left to speculate that perhaps the catastrophe never materialized.On the fundamental level, Halzitt falls prey to the quintessential free-market fallacy - an unshakable belief in self-interested rationalism on the part of the capital class. But of course contemporary readers know that racism, sexism and other psychological blind spots historically prevented otherwise worthy credit risks from receiving a fair shake and that government interventions of various kinds have been required to address the problem. Halzitt acknowledges none of this.Finally, historical experience has not been kind to Halzitt's view of things. Halzitt recommends deregulation and unqualified tax cuts for corporations and the rich. They will re-invest in the market, we are told, and the economy will grow. New businesses will come into being or old ones will expand. Jobs will appear, production will rise, more money and goods will come into circulation and everyone will be richer. Reaganomics used the term ""trickle down theory.""But under Reagan, things did not go quite as planned (corporations and the rich found other uses for their increased funds) and by the end of George H. Bush's only term, we were deep in recession. Further deregulation under Clinton and Bush II does not seem to have been much help in building economic sustainability.Perhaps this book's greatest strength lies in teaching critical thinking about economic thought itself. While Hazlitt's specific critiques against continuation of the New Deal and the abuses of unionized labor did have merit, it is his general thesis - that selfish interests will blind people to some important aspect of any given policy's total outcome - is unassailably true, with a capital T.Just remember to turn the same critical eye upon Hazlitt, too."
1296,B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,AWP70V34YS2IA,"Curt D ""Economic Philosophy and Political Eco...",8/12,5.0,1129507200,The only lesson the average person will ever need,"This is the easiest book that the average person can use to grasp economics, and in particular, the economics of all groups of people over an extended time period - ie: government policies.The book is a single, simple, practical example, followed by a series of examples of how governments break with the lesson and the outcome of doing so. It is a simple lesson, followed by simple examples, for people who have no experience with economics, or those who find the mathematical approach in college either overwhelming or irrelevant.For the average person, there may not need to be much else one needs to consider when weighing matters of import as a voter.Some of the reviews that are negative seem to express a dissatisfaction with the structure of the argument as being polemic. But, this is either nonsensical or a misunderstanding. When one wishes to illustrate the impact of a single idea, and the consequences of abusing it, and to do so on a vast scale, against those things which we assume daily to be successful, then one can choose to be Adam Smith, and drag the reader through tortuous detail with which he is unfamiliar, or one can paint broad debates, with which one is quite familiar, and which can be applied to one's daily experiences.This is simply the strategy one uses to communicate such ideas to a population that requests such an approach. It is not that such ideas cannot be conveyed through more detailed means, or that such a thing has not been done by other authors elsewhere, such as Hayek, Mises and Schumpater.For those on the left, who are in a long term campaign to destroy individual property rights, and those who deny that there is a necessary ignorance in individuals, groups or institutions, in a complex division of knoweldge, production and labor, this entire line of thinking appears either faulty or disingenuous. But it is not only honest, but true.For those that think government policy over the past 100 years has been successful, it has been successful in the same way that an inheritance given to a college student, allows the student to spend down the work of his predecessors. Money is not the only capital that must be earned and produced, so is knowledge and especially that knowledge which one cannot gain of one's own accord, but only through the experience of those who came before him. In particular, his family and culture.It took thousands of years to develop the capital-store of knowledge in European civilization, of which we are a part, and this knowledge resides in very simple ideas that we are surrounded by every day. This knowledge is a set of principles by which we can exist and prosper in an ever-expanding division of knowledge and labor, producing more and more complex goods and services in a larger and larger population, most of whom do not know each other, and who may not even know the end consumer, or what use their goods are put to or why. In a world of this complexity, we are necessarily ignorant, we must face an uncertain and ever changing future.It is expressly NOT a community of similar people all of whom know each other and share equally in production and it's results - which is the philosophy of a village or tribe. It is a simple primitive economic strategy for use by those who know little, and have few options.This evolution is the process of making peasants into princes. It is the process of transforming primitive social capitalism, which involves economic units of villages and families -- who do the same thing repeatedly and are certain of it, into modern western capitalism which involves economic units of families and individuals -- who do different things all the time, and are uncertain of everything. It makes all men into entrepreneurs. And in doing so, makes all men service all others, even if he does not know them.No man who has risen from poverty by building a business through discipline and hard work in the productive economy (versus the political, religious or academic economy - which are consumptive) and who would have his childen do the same, does so without learning this lesson.When a government prints money or redistributes money, it interferes with the process by which the generations in the population learn those habits traditions, ethics and behaviors that allowed them to raise from one economic strata in the division of knowledge and labor, into another. A loan to start a business is one thing, for it is the same as financing an education. A gift to make your life easier is something else altogether. It is giving a man a fish, not teaching him how to.This process works from the opposite direction as well. Even charity, which was the material obligation of those who were wealthy before government interference in the economy, and the traditional obligations and social pressure for the wealthy has been eroded.In the act of redistribution, the goverment indirectly manufactures economic ignorance in it's populace. Hazlitt does not say this directly, but he still says it.Our economy fell apart in the 1960's and 1970's, with what in the future will be called a great depression of the 1970's. It has been wealthy enough to tolerate this behavior since the 1980's, largely because of technological innovation and the prosperity that came from the competitive need to adopt it. But our position in the world is changing. European redistribution of wealth and social programs is failing now, and will of demographic necessity fail in the next two decades. It will fail here as well. Why such ponzi scheme's are comprehensible to the investment community, and not to the body politic will be a question to answer for sociologists for years to come.The peasants need to develop trust in one another, need to earn that trust in one another. They need to become comfortable with an uncertain future where they cannot understand all that happens in the vast universe of human cooperation, and to think longer term than their traditions tell them. And they must save. Because the future is uncertain in either case, and the repetitive certainty of the peasant philosophy was always an illusion. The had little to learn and learned little. There was little change and they changed little. They knew those close to them and knew others little. People starved. They died in ignorance and poverty. In a division of knowledge and labor, everything is so cheap, and increasingly so, that they instead, prosper and populations increase accordingly. And the price we all pay for this luxury is constant change, constant learning, and psychological uncertainty.There are means by which such inter-generational economic knoweldge can be imparted to a population, and by which the people can be compelled to adopt it despite the fact that they do not understand it. One can use religion and social ostricization as did the calvinist protestants and european jews, one can use ideological government by way of force and violence, as did the communists, socialists and facists. These methods remove choice from the individual and prescribe how we should act. But one can also achieve this end by using property rights alone, and a judiciary who does not prescribe anything at all, but only resolves differences in conflict over property, and nothing else is necessary. No politicians, prophets, intellectuals, sages. The population learns to serve on another without direction and prescription. This is the lesson.This is a conflict between princes and peasants. It is between property rights, individual responsibility for himself, savings, entrepreneurship and courage in the face of uncertainty, versus communal property, perpetual dependence, poverty and the comfort in the certainty of that future.We can all be princes of countries of one, or peasants in a country of billions. Hazlitt tells us the one lesson we need to know if we would all be princes."
1297,B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,A1VA170GUYGTB,Paula L. Craig,6/9,4.0,1090022400,Good But Some Holes,"Henry Hazlitt's book starts with a single lesson-that economics means looking beyond the immediate effects of any act or policy to the consequences of it for everyone. The rest of the book is a series of short chapters giving examples of the application of this lesson.Hazlitt's lesson in itself is great. I wish it were better known. His examples vary in quality. Some are a bit dated; natural for a book which mostly dates to 1946. The chapter on rent control is as relevant today as ever. The discussion of the cost of war and other types of destructive activities punctures a misconception that is still common. In his discussion of unemployment, however, he fails to mention immigration and population growth as part of the cause.The section on tariffs is good as far as it goes. The problem with his analysis is that transportation today is in effect heavily subsidized. Oil companies and the like don't have to pay for the air pollution and climate change caused by their products, or for roads, or for the armies protecting the oil flow. Subsidized transportation costs make nonsense of the idea that local and imported goods are really on the same footing. Free trade with countries having non-existent environmental laws simply sets up a race to the bottom, with responsible companies heading for bankruptcy and irresponsible companies destroying the economic foundations of their own countries.Hazlitt swallows whole the idea that growth in GNP is always good and can continue indefinitely. Given that GNP doesn't include the costs of pollution, resource depletion, the effects of population growth, or quality of life, this is very questionable. Hazlitt needs to apply his own &quot;one lesson&quot; here.Hazlitt states in his first sentence that economics is haunted by more fallacies than any other study known to man. I tend to agree. Hazlitt points out some of them and does it in a very readable way. Hazlitt fails with some of the other fallacies. Read the book, but read it with a grain of salt."

Martin,6/9,4.0,1074297600,Choose some alternatives and map them to the real world,"Of the positive reveiews, they seem to be amazed that someone can define economics. It's not really rocket science, and, in an age of plenty, it's not really about scarcity. It's about individuals making choices to maximize value. They may be bad choices, uniformed choices or perverse choices, but they have, in the final analysis, impact limited to the individual. And in most cases result in some level of increased individual satisfaction.The real danger, according to Hazlitt, is when the choices of a few people, with same kinds of fallacies noted above, are coercive, enforced by government or monopolies. Which leads us to to the negative reviews.The negatives, if we can be allowed to throw out the obvious loser rants, seem to be concerned mainly with rapacious corporations, free trade among inequal countries and natural monopolies. While these are certainly provide distortions of individual choice and informed consent, they do in the long run tend to be self correcting -- see government-sanctioned coal and oil monopolies. The real interest is in how to minimize the effects of these diseconomies.Hazlitt would argue that they are self-correcting via the collective effect of individual choices. The Marxists would argue that action based upon the sceeding of individual choice to a collective power is the solution. Surely, if we can assume there is no absolute, theoretical winner in this debate, we can look to the real world, based upon the actions of multiple forms of government and millions of individuals to provide some guidance on which path leads to the most for the most.To that end, I would challenge you to read Hazlitt's book and a Marxist equivalent like Ivan Ilich's &quot;Tools for Conviviality&quot; and then, accepting both as plausibly complete and material, match them against your experience of recent history and your hopes for your personal future."

However his criticism of the unnamed ""brilliant economists""(p. 28)- read: Keynes-is certainly baseless and an attempt to debase another economist's (though I struggle to put Hazlitt in such a class) work for the reason that their works are difficult to read is quite contemptible. Are the works of Shakespeare less valuable, less brilliant because they are not easily interpreted by the average man? I think not, and it is from whence which we are lead to the largest, if not only, redeeming quality of EIOL: it is easy to read. A simple book by and for the simple man. True economics is fare more complicated that Hazlitt would have the reader believe, and despite what others might say, is fairly math intensive. However, I digress...EIOL, as such, a fallacious title, begins with what is a brief comment on economic theory and policy. However, as he sums up his point by saying that ""The art of economics consists of looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists of tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group, but for all groups.""(p. 17) All right folks, that's it. There is your one lesson. Go forth and spread the word. Those who are not versed in the study of economics I'm sure may arrive at the conclusion that this is something new, somehow ground breaking. However to anybody who is well-read in economics, to those who are a student of this subject, this seems to be, and is, nothing more than a pointing out of the obvious. Thanks for letting us know though, Henry. I thought all that stuff about the long run, short run, micro and macro economics was all fiction. Glad he told us.One could write an entire book refuting that which Hazlitt postulates, pointing out the errors, miscues, and theory which Hazlitt left out. I'm sure it was a mistake. Really. I am. I will note a few lines here, adding to that which has already been said by like-minded reviewers.Hazlitt ultimately ignores aggregate demand in chapters 2 & 3. Did he not say that we were supposed to be examining this with the perspective of ""all groups"" in mind? Furthermore, he attempts to use chapter 2, an examination into microeconomics, and apply it to aggregates and macroeconomic situations. Economists have long learned that this is not feasible. In the broken window example Hazlitt has us assume, only for thereason, we can suspect, to illustrate his point, that the Baker in question will spend the $250 on a suit. However, what fails to mention is that the possibility of savings exists. Had the Baker been planning to save the money, Hazlitt would struggle to make his point.In chapter 3, Hazlitt again ignores aggregate demand, but also the consumption function, and goes on to assume full employment, which is again, a special case which cannot be applied to the whole. In a number of instances he contradicts himself, though this is not limited to chapter 3. It would be a waste of time here to list all of them, however, consider the following: if the destruction of a building is a harm to all of those in a community (p. 28), and no demand is created, and more importantly, lost, where then is the harm? If my $250 which I would have spent a spent on a suit now goes to repairing my house, how then does the demand of the community suffer? Again on 28, when examining the farmer, can his demand not be greater, or less, than the available quantity of wheat he is able to supply? Could the demand on wheat not be less or greater than that which the farmer is able to supply? But we are supposed to believe that supply is equal to demand? I think not. On the subject of contradictions, returning to Lesson 1 for a second, Hazlitt criticizes the ""terms of abuse"" (p. 19), but uses the term ""new economics"", as his favorite whipping boy, falling into the same trap with which he assumes he has ensnared Keynesian economists. He blindly rejects all of Keynesian, or ""new economic"" theory, not crediting its merits or following reasoning. For shame, Henry. For shame.Students of economics do not read this book because it holds little value...except perhaps in showing how to present a poor argument. Hazlitt is guilty of employing reactionary ""reasoning"" to that of Keynesian theory, as noted by the multiple insults and jabs at Keynes and his followers, though he oft fails call them as such. This book makes some interesting, bordering on valid, points at times, however the degree to which it fails far outweighs the benefits. Readers of this book who are not economics students should not that this is certainly note the end-all and be-all of economic works or theory, and that every work on economics will be flawed to some degree. Economics students who reject Keynesian theory, read ""The Failure of the New Economics: An Analysis of the Keynsian Fallacies"" by Hazlitt. You need to read it with The General Theory though.In closing, somebody suggested putting this book in your bathroom. I'd suggest that too, though I suspect our reasoning behind doing so might be different."

In the second half of the 20th century, every government in the world that adopted Keynesian economics became enormously prosperous. Every time a government tried the so called ""free market"" economics Hazlitt recommends the result was high unemployment and a concentration of wealth. The sad fact is that some people are much, much better at making money than others, and that absent some government control, the rich wind up with everything and the workers with the bare minimum necessary to sustain life: the Iron Law of Wages. There is no doubt that free-market capitalism is the best economic system in every arena where there is a profit to be made. But the free market capitalists have to harden their hearts against the children, the elderly, the sick, and the victims of natural and man-made disasters, off whom no profit can be made.

There are only a few of the chapters with any redeemable characteristics, but by no means is this book anything close to resembling something fit for human consumption, unless perhaps you are doing an anthropological study on 20th and 21st century mass-delusion.Chapter V: Taxes Discourage ProductionThe vast majority of this book is as fallacious and absurd as the propaganda promoted in this chapter. If I were to write a review of this book in its entirety, while illustrating each and every fallacy, the review would be longer than the book itself; so necessarily, I'll focus on a single argument in Chapter 5, perhaps the shortest chapter in the book.In this chapter he promulgates the quintessential argument of the modern day Republicans/Libertarians: that lowering taxes promotes jobs. Hazlitt mentions specifically personal and corporate income taxes. I could disprove this argument historically, but that will require more content than disproving it analytically, as follows.Hazlitt alludes to a number in saying: ""A certain amount of taxes is of course indispensable to carry on essential government functions"" without ever specifying a number or a guideline that could determine what that number should be. A few sentences later he says ""But the larger the percentage of the national income taken by taxes the greater the deterrent to private production and employment."" There are numerous problems with this sentence but we'll focus on just one: presently many mega-corporations pay 0% or near 0% corporate taxes. Hazlitt argues in the previous sentence that there are ""essential government functions"" yet an increase from a 0% tax rate would be a ""deterrent to private production"". These two ideals are at such odds with each other that any level of taxation, or lack thereof, can be justified in any degree. To be timely with Hazlitt's own lifetime, let us consider a 48% (war-time) corporate tax rate from the previous example; now how do we decide which of these arguments apply? What is an essential government function? How do you validate that a company was going to use that money for production and not for enriching the CEO and upper management? This is vague on purpose, and this and other similar arguments have been used to reduce corporate taxes down to nothing on the mega-corporations, while we are left holding the bag.He then steps into briefly discussing personal income taxes. I'm not the hugest fan of income taxes in the way they presently exist, I think that they are a method by which unscrupulous politicians basically buy patronage from the voters with their own money, and an elimination of them (at the lower end) would perhaps cause a more nuanced and vigorous discussion of what creates prosperity among the general populace; as opposed to the voters allowing any trespass as long as the elected promise to lower taxes. Yet I can see the lack of justification that Hazlitt has for removing them, and the benefit to society when they are applied in a progressive fashion. That is presently not at all what we have at all in our system, and if they were re-implemented as originally intended with the middle class paying very little and it starting to go up at the upper-middle class levels then it would radically change the dialogue, and quality of life, in the country.First Hazlitt argues that high income taxes discourage work, but he's wrong in the following, critical, scenario.1) Imagine if there was one person in the company that effectively got to choose how much he was paid? If you were given this opportunity, how much would you pay yourself? The allocator of resources in a company (capital investment, money, labor) is primarily the CEO. The CEO has to go through the board in order to approve his wages, but in our modern world with our modern laws and systems of corporate governance this is little more than a formality in many major Fortune 500 companies. But if the CEO wanted to try to convince the board to give him a substantial raise that would make him pay 90% of it in income taxes, the board would have little incentive to let him, and more importantly he would have little incentive in pursuing it himself. This is a multi-causal problem to which having a very high progressive income tax can do much in stopping the abuse of. So what happens to that extra money that would have gone into the pockets of the CEO and upper management if prevented by tax policy? Well, if we look at history, that money was reinvested into the company and it lifted the general people's standard of living as a function of economic growth. If the pay is effectively `capped' in this manner, perhaps the CEO and other `higher ups' will (and should) receive a higher compensation for the importance of their work, in the form of company stocks. This will also encourage them to aim for the long term growth of the company, rather than looting it intentionally or as a by-product of ""short-termism"" and then diving out with a golden parachute, as is so commonplace today. Economic growth is much higher if there is the maximum amount of reinvestment; this is what the very high progressive income tax promotes. In this system, value creation is rewarded (long term growth) and short-termism and `looting' is discouraged.Hazlitt also argues that reinvestment is discouraged by ""high levels of taxation"".2) Assume the CEO got the money in the above scenario (not hard to do, since we live in a world now that has very low income tax rates on this form of abuse). Now what does he do with it? Does he start a new startup company? Not likely at all, after working for a company enough to get a CEO position why start over as a 'small timer' again? Why do anything but perform your tenure at the company you're CEO at and then retire? Entrepreneurs start businesses; people that make a bunch of money in the stock market don't, people that are existing CEO's don't, people that come from dynastic families of great wealth don't, at least they don't in any greater observable proportion than the general populace. I would suggest that they are much less likely to become an entrepreneur of a new company - for those of you unaware: the primary point of becoming rich is that you no longer have to work - a novel concept. If you want evidence of this please look at Fortune 500 and who founded them and what their background was, if this 'theory' that the rich create jobs and by extension taxing the rich destroys jobs was correct you'd at least expect to see a larger proportional amount of the ""a priori rich"" in these roles. In summation: A.) People with ideas and the moxy to see them to fruition start businesses, not those with incredible sums of money. B.) Newly founded businesses typically borrow from banks and are self financed by-in-large over the private investor to which lower income taxes benefit.I know personally a handful of people that make 6 figure salaries a year and they work incredibly hard for that money, and I consider that they truly earned it, and that they are paying too much in taxes at present. And yet their income has a ""reality-check"" as what they are paid reflects a `market price' for their services. No such ""market-check"" or ""sanity-check"" exists for the upper management of many of these mega-corps; this is the problem that is smoke-screened behind arguments furthered by Hazlitt's book and his modern contemporaries.So in this scenario, high income taxes that are progressively applied encourage production. This flies in the face of all Libertarian and ""right wing"" (whatever that fake dichotomy means anymore) ideology, yet it is what is observed. There is no ideological ""general rule"", as promoted by Hazlitt, that you can use to presuppose the outcome of a specific tax without looking at the specifics. But Hazlitt doesn't want you look at specifics, he is training you to be a reactionary. There are some useful things in this book - as there are in nearly all books. Yet, if a book, such as this one, is about 95% garbage and 5% useful analysis; I'd tell you that there are better places to pan for gold than in an open sewer.Be mindful that, in this book, in a chapter this small, there are many more fallacies that Hazlitt packs in that I must leave aside for the sake of brevity.One of the primary reasons justifying these methods of taxation that has hitherto been unmentioned, is if they are progressively implemented, they can prevent the scenario that we are living right now - a political establishment that has been bought with this ill-gotten money. By a willful chiseling away of our laws on taxation, it has empowered a new class of dynastic robber-barons in our modern era."
1309,B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,A3BQYQJMIQ20V8,Amazon_reviews,14/69,1.0,1322524800,Flawed,"The basic idea of this book basically focuses on the idea of Pareto Efficiency (which is the economic idea that a policy should benefit all or it should not be undertaken). He takes Pareto Efficiency to extremes and uses it to basically launch into an attack on any wealth redistribution. The major criticism is that no economic policy could ever benefit every single person.Many of his ideas are flawed:High taxes discourage production: in fact from 1949-79, when highest tax rate was 70-90%, GDP grew at 2.4%, then when taxes were cut (1979-90) GDP growth was 2%. So in fact high taxes don't necessarily mean low production.Price fixing is not good, even as far as minimum wage should be abolished. But these price fixing (including rent control) are there for the poor. Price controls are placed when the free market allocates the poor less than a fair share of a good. This applies for minimum wage. Minimum wage is there to protect the poor, not the middle class or rich, who are often not working at minimum wage. Minimum wage may decrease the profits of a company and increase cost to the consumer, but this allows some redistribution from the more well off to the less well off. If we abolish minimum wage, it is the poor who suffer. Cut the minimum wage, people would have to work harder to earn the same amount. Minimum wage might not be efficient for the rich and well off, but a society is better off when more are protected.Overall, this flawed analysis highlights how some economic policy is there to benefit the rich.Read this book instead:Economics for the Rest of Us: Debunking the Science That Makes Life Dismal"

Essentially, the lesson is that in economics you need to look just not at the immediate effects of an economic policy on a targeted group, but also at the long-term effects and the impact on all groups. Seems simple and obvious, but isn't always practiced.The book consists of about 25 chapters, each covering a different policy issue such as public works, public savings, price fixing and rent control. It then discusses each policy's immediate and future impacts and stretches your thinking to groups other than just the target of the policy. This is the magic of the book: no matter your political philosophy or economic background, Economics in One Lesson will help you see some of the issues in a new light.It is very anti-Keynesian and somewhat Austrian in its outlook. It fits more on the conservative side of the political spectrum. I wish that it contained supportive data for the positions it takes, but that really isn't the purpose of the book and it doesn't purport to do that.

Smyth ""EyeLean5280""",8/16,4.0,1261094400,"Very Good, But Be Aware of What You're Getting","This is an edited version of a review that I'd previously removed. People didn't feel the first version was helpful, a fact which I suspect to be due to two possibilities, depending upon the individuals involved. For one thing, it was very long. For another, although it praised Halzitt on many points, it was not an obeisant psalm that accepted without question every single thing he asserted (this was the problem for one highly emotional commentator).So out of sensitivity to the preciousness of readers' time, I offer a shorter version. I am, however, still a skeptic and agnostic when it comes to economic schools of thought, so if you worship at the alter of Smith (or even Marx, Keynes, or indeed, any of the august minds that have turned their hand to this soft science), I'm afraid this review will not be for you.Economics In One Lesson (written in 1946, re-published with some updating in 1978) was intended as a layman's introduction to free-market arguments against the continuation of New Deal policies in the postwar era. Halzitt writes beautifully, always respecting the intelligence of the reader. He neither inundates with professional jargon nor clutters up the pages with tons of tables and graphs. He explains and illustrates thoroughly yet not exhaustively. The result is a highly approachable work that has remained popular for decades.Hazlitt's arguments are cogent and it is easy to find plenty of merit in them. However, they are often strongest where they are obsolete. His descriptions of how credit works are downright touching in their quaintness (think: the Bailey Building and Loan in ""It's a Wonderful Life""). In EIOL, there is nothing resembling the kinds of byzantine credit shenanigans which have caused so much trouble of late.Another weakness of the book is that many of the claims made in the original were not re-visited in 1978. Halzitt complained in '46, for example, that the GI Bill was extending credit hither and yon without the tough standards necessary to protect the investment. Halzitt failed to add a footnote in the '78 version letting us know how his dire predictions of mass default turned out. Readers are left to speculate that perhaps the catastrophe never materialized.On the fundamental level, Halzitt falls prey to the quintessential free-market fallacy - an unshakable belief in self-interested rationalism on the part of the capital class. But of course contemporary readers know that racism, sexism and other psychological blind spots historically prevented otherwise worthy credit risks from receiving a fair shake and that government interventions of various kinds have been required to address the problem. Halzitt acknowledges none of this.Finally, historical experience has not been kind to Halzitt's view of things. Halzitt recommends deregulation and unqualified tax cuts for corporations and the rich. They will re-invest in the market, we are told, and the economy will grow. New businesses will come into being or old ones will expand. Jobs will appear, production will rise, more money and goods will come into circulation and everyone will be richer. Reaganomics used the term ""trickle down theory.""But under Reagan, things did not go quite as planned (corporations and the rich found other uses for their increased funds) and by the end of George H. Bush's only term, we were deep in recession. Further deregulation under Clinton and Bush II does not seem to have been much help in building economic sustainability.Perhaps this book's greatest strength lies in teaching critical thinking about economic thought itself. While Hazlitt's specific critiques against continuation of the New Deal and the abuses of unionized labor did have some merit, it is his general thesis - that selfish interests will blind people to some aspect of any given policy's total outcome - is unassailably true, with a capital T.Just remember to turn the same critical eye upon Hazlitt, too."

I set out to kill two birds with one stone, however found myself rather surprised. While it applied to economics and taught and reiterated my class at school, it really drove home the ideas of philosophy. This book related to my philosphy and critical thinking class, because Henry Hazlitt makes a claim in the first chapter of the book and the following twenty five are the lesson being applied in economic terms. He makes sure you understand and can apply his claim/lesson to the real world, all while showing you the faults many economist make. All of his supporting stories are relevant and make since, they are all clearly written making sure his own view is shown, and they are complete, taking into consideration all points of view.The book points out the fallacies of claims made by economists, and in doing so teaches you economics, and how to think correctly as one. He does not, however, take a typical approach to this economics thing. He throws you right in and teaches you the lesson right away. His lesson asks you to remember one thing.""The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act of policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.""This claim was something I was taught in my economics class, and I gladly related to it while reading. Some of my favorite chapters had to do with the broken window fallacy, minimum wage laws, and the mirage on inflation. All breaking down the faults of our government and the faults in our reasoning. Every chapter in the book brings home the main message of looking past the up front realities. To look outside of the box.I felt Hazlitt took on a fair view of the people. He stated many times,""if we have trained ourselves to look beyond immediate to secondary consequences."" I think this applies to many people. The word if leaves it open, covering all individuals. He also puts in his lesson, ""not merely for one group but for all groups."" He does look at it for all groups, mentioning all people who would feel the effects of whatever program is put into place.I honestly liked reading the book. If you are an economics or philosophy major, both of which I am not, the book is worth more closer review. I would recommend it to anyone looking to find faults or learn economics."

Perhaps with so few of this kind -- economic works which are logical and correct -- I should have given it 5 Stars. I expect a lot.Henry is right: Too often so-called ""economists"" take only short term, one-sided, special interest group viewpoints and come up with half-baked economic plans and plots. Enough people accept these, allowing such ideas to become everyday government practice; practices that frankly screw us all in the long run. From the idiocy of Keynes to the ideas behind the communistic thievery of FDR's ""New Deal"", Hazlitt cuts through and clarifies many false economic concepts. Hazlitt explains and demonstrates again and again how real economics is the science of the effects of any financial practice on everything and everyone. He also points out conceptually how similarly a country's government's economic decisions and preferences mimic the values and choices of one's own pocketbook. And Henry offers a very nice reprise of Bastiat's the seen versus the unseen.Unfortunately, Hazlitt suffers from one of the same problems Ayn Rand did. Since this book was first published during Rand's writing of Atlas Shrugged, I suspect Economics in One Lesson may have had a large effect on both style and content of Atlas. Both authors had to fight so long and so hard for their ideas, with so little appreciation they often resorted to sarcasm just to make a little mental space for themselves. This puts a strain on the reader, as one attempts to understand, integrate and connect up the longer chain of events and results of various economic practices undertaken by governments and the people they represent.Also, though his points are excellent, he often leaves certain links in the chain vague, expecting the reader to just get it--when crossing those bridges on one's own requires some serious backtracking and analysis.Regardless, his ideas are so important, and once one gets to them, so well made, I wish Henry could have written a simpler, more direct, less sarcastic, less complaining, less wordy, better-linked version of this very good work.Nevertheless, if I were able to speak with Henry, I would say: ""Thank you."""

This version of Economics has recently come to the mainstream in light of the economic hardships and out of control spending from the federal government. This book is dated but contains a lot of relevant information. I was surprised to see just how big of a concern inflation and deficit spending was in the 40s to these very intelligent and honest economists.What will you find inside? Well the bottom line is everything you do, no matter how noble, affects someone else in the world of economics. If the government steps in to help one group of people it is hurting another group of people, usually resulting in a net harm. This is because anytime you artificially stimulate, subsidize or promote one behavior over another you are promoting inefficiency or protecting the least profitable option. This raises prices on goods and decreases real wages. The only way to create wealth and grow the economy is to produce more of a product with the same or less effort. This will in the long run make everyones cost of living lower and bring more prosperity to the country. A great example he used was the hypothetical situation where the government continued to subsidize the horse and buggy industry despite the innovation of the automobile. Sure jobs were lost when cars started replacing horse drawn carriages but eventually more jobs were created and the country was a whole lot better off. He also dispels the myth of saving too much money and discusses why it's necessary to save and what your savings accomplishes.Other discussions include real world examples of why labor unions are harmful to the economy, why it's bad to raise minimum wage, evils of price fixing, the problem with subsidizing, rent stabilization and who it hurts, inequities and harm of tariffs, and much much more. I deduct a star from the book because it got a little repetitive after awhile. A lot of the arguments are repeated and there is a definite recurring theme in every problem he poses. This is not to detract from it's validity, and each problem does propose a unique flavor of this principle. A lot of these things I knew were intuitively wrong but the examples he gives makes you nod your head and puts your gut thought into words. This book was a refreshingly easy read and very insightful."

Hazlitt claims that today's economists forget the most frequent fallacy committed by professionals, the fallacy of short-term effects on specific groups rather than society as a whole. Hazlitt utilizes multiple examples of past economic policies that have failed, and what initially brought those policies to closure. After thoroughly reading Economics In One Lesson, my thoughts on the economy have transformed from little knowledge of the subject to a complete understanding of past economic failures.The premises on production, inflation, and wages carry true statements, but seem outdated. Statistics and numbers used for basic economic explanations are recorded prior to 1980. For economic interest the premises remain true, but need updating for today's economist.Hazlitt illustrates excellent reasoning to the fallacy of short-term effects on specified groups through many simple ideas. The first reason describes means of production and societies resistance to work for low wages. For companies to produce, workers are needed as producers. If company A's output increases, workers wages increase. If company A has an increase in production consequently company B suffers. Company B's output decreases, and the workers receive no wage increase. Society will only see the benefits of company A, not the monetary losses by Company B. Secondly, prices, profits, and costs to society. Hazlitt relates prices to the law of supply and demand. When consumers demand more of a product that is available from a certain business, people will buy more of the product. Both the price and profits will increase for the business. If the demand is met, the supply increases production meaning consumers increase their buying from that particular company. If consumers only buy from that particular company, other related businesses lose the profits for their product. Hazlitt's arguments remain deductively valid throughout the explanations of the prior fallacy.Economics commits multiple fallacies if not carefully followed through with each policy and system. Hazlitt outlines many fallacies with the main point representing the fallacy of short term effects on one particular group rather than the long term effects on all groups, or the fallacy of over looking secondary consequences. Hazlitt briefly describes other fallacies, such as, the broken window fallacy and overlooking the general consequences fallacy. Although Hazlitt depicts several fallacies, I failed to see where he committed fallacies of his own.Economics can be broken down into many parts and Hazlitt thoroughly describes each piece of those parts. Hazlitt's points are made exceptionally clear and to the point. Hazlitt's ideas are simple for the unclear mind but involve a considerable amount of thinking for today's economist. As stated before, economists often fail to realize secondary consequences to their actions.The economic fallacy claims are fairly consistent throughout the book. The central fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences constitutes a major portion of the book. Hazlitt uses several illustrations to back up his claims of the failure to see secondary consequences and the impact they had on economic policies. Almost every economic policy commits a fallacy, and Hazlitt easily describes the fallacies and failures to the readers.The arguments that Hazlitt conveys provide a complete understanding for economic fallacies and the impact they have on policies today. All evidence that Hazlitt uses on economic fallacies relates policy failures to overlooking secondary consequences. If today's economist only see the benefit of company A or product 1 rather than the suffering of company B or profit losses of product 2, economic policies will continue to fail. Hazlitt brings all aspects of the fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences into account for the purposes of this book. Hazlitt's arguments seem fair and support all views of economic progressions and failures in the mid 1900's. The presentation of both sides creates equal representation for all readers. The opposing views carry strong arguments, but do not change the weight of the writer's outlook. Hazlitt's opinion illustrates the truth of economics, and the impact of policy failures on society.The key points of Hazlitt's book touch on several different economic stabilizers. Hazlitt begins with a strong introduction about the fallacy of overlooking general and secondary consequences. It is made clear that many professionals commit this fallacy over and over again. If economists and other professionals thoroughly verify the benefits and losses by the whole group rather than the benefits or impacts on one group, policies enacted will continue to work and increase profits, production, and costs in the economy today. Other fallacies are used to demonstrate the power of overlooking secondary consequences. The broken window fallacy, illustrates the benefits and losses within three parties. If a window is broken in Company A, but the owner wanted a product from Company B, the owner's situation becomes complicated. Now A has to buy a window from Company C instead of the needed product from B. Company A loses money to C, which should have supported B. Company C benefits, but Company B suffers. Hazlitt uses great ideas to support all of his arguments, and can be easily understood by all readers."

This is definitely ""the shortest and surest way to understand basic economics"". The author takes a unique approach by introducing all the main concepts through ""exposition"". As he says ""...its effort is to show that many of the ideas which now pass for brilliant innovations and advances are in fact mere revivals of ancient errors, and a further proof of the dictum that those who are ignorant of the past are condemned to repeat it."" The main premise of the book is that: ""Economics, as we have now seen again and again, is a science of recognizing secondary consequences. It is also a science of seeing general consequences. It is the science of tracing the effects of some proposed or existing policy not only on some special interest in the short run, but on the general interest in the long run."".In addition to the unique approach taken by the author he is committed to making the material accessible to all: ""I have tried to write this book as simply and with as much freedom from technicalities as is consistent with reasonable accuracy, so that it can be fully understood by a reader with no previous acquaintance with economics."" A definite read for all!Below are excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:1- ""A certain amount of taxes is of course indispensable to carry on essential government functions. Reasonable taxes for this purpose need not hurt production much. The king of government services then supplied in return, which among other things safeguard production itself, more than compensate for this. But the larger the percentage of the national income taken by taxes the greater the deterrent to private production and employment. When the total tax burden grows beyond a bearable size, the problem of devising taxes that will not discourage and disrupt production becomes insoluble.""2- ""There is no limit to the amount of work to be done as long as any human need or wish that work could fill remains unsatisfied. In a modern exchange economy, the most work will be done when prices, costs, and wages are in the best relations with each other.""3- ""...our real objective is to maximize production. In doing this, full employment - that is, the absence of involuntary idleness - becomes a necessary by-product. But production is the end, employment merely the means. We cannot continuously have the fullest production without full employment. But we can very easily have full employment without full production.""4- ""Paradoxical as it may seem to some, it is just as necessary to the health of a dynamic economy that dying industries be allowed to die as that growing industries be allowed to grow. The first process is essential to the second.""5- ""So government policy should be directed, not to imposing more burdensome requirements on employers, but to following policies that encourage profits, that encourage employers to expand, to invest in newer and better machines to increase the productivity of workers - in brief, to encourage capital accumulation, instead of discouraging it - and to increase both employment and wage rates.""6- ""Profits, in short, resulting from the relationships of costs to prices, not only tell us which goods it is most economical to make, but which are the most economical ways to make them. These questions must be answered by a socialist system no less than by a capitalist one; they must be answered by any conceivable economic system; and for the overwhelming bulk of the commodities and services that are produced, the answers supplied by profit and loss under competitive free enterprise are incomparably superior to those that could be obtained by any other method.""7-""Inflation is the autosuggestion, the hypnotism, the anesthetic, that has dulled the pain of the operation for him. Inflation is the opium of the people.""8- ""Saving, in short, in the modern world, is only another form of spending. The usual difference is that the money is turned over to someone else to spend on means to increase production."""

He address topics such as:Short term vs. long term view of economic principle and policiesDo public works truly stimulate the economy?How much taxation is too much?Does all automation destroy jobs in the long term?Does full employment always mean full production?Who's ""protected"" by tariffs?Saving the X Industry (Bailout anyone?)How does government price fixing work?Minimum wage laws and what they really doDo unions really raise wages?What is the function of profits? What truly causes Inflation? What does it truly mean to save and create wealth?Do any of these topics sound interesting or applicable to what you're hearing in today's political talk in the media? Get this. Hazlitt wrote this in 1946! The principles he lays out and the fallacies he exposes could have been written about current events today! This, to me, gives weight to his school of thought. If his economic worldview could be applied to virtually every day and age, it bolsters its credibility. Instead of fly-by-night knee jerk reactionary policies, Haziltt, a member of the Austrian school of economics, gives common sense explanations to what most of the political world would prefer to keep as complicated as possible.

1364,B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,AQEBTMSP1FQ8P,FinancePro,4/4,5.0,1329696000,The Lesson of Liberty Is Difficult for Many to Learn,"I purchased the 1979 edition of Hazlitt's book as a MBA candidate at Pepperdine University. My professor, the erudite and sharp minded Dr. George Reisman, wanted to instill in his students the fundamental principle of liberty and how government attempted to disrupt and eradicate that liberty at every opportunity. Intervention was its means and totalitarianism was its method.Hazlitt is no exception when it comes to upholding liberty. His book attests to the vitality of his work. The book's rankings on Amazon demonstrates how oppressed people seek for answers to fend off the oppressors and their interventionists policies through a corrupt government. He begins the work at the place Ken Starr did in a lecture I attended in which he reviewed his prosecutorial experience with former President Clinton: the broken window. There are striking parallels between the economic principle and the moral principle that Starr applied. Both involved the impact of vandelism in a corrupt society. The two vandels existed in separate segments of society, but the net effect was the same: the destruction of long term value that may not be visible to the naked eye. One was theft of private property through its destruction (the broken window) and the other the theft of societal morals through political corruption.One might ask, ""How in the world can you make this parallel?"" Easy. Hazlitt argues from the fallacy of destruction. When destruction occurs in any area of society, whether in economics or politics, part of society gets destroyed. He argues that economists who argue for the destructiveness of war see it as a good thing when the opposite is true. When destruction occurs, it wipes out capital, and when that happens, wealth declines. The same is true in Clinton's case, except the capital of a moral society declined (and it continues to do so thanks to an immoral president). Adam Smith makes it clear that economics and morality work hand in hand. Hazlitt confirms this.The other part of destruction is when the government intervenes through heavy taxation and regulation. It performs a similar theft of capital by converting capital into consumption (i.e., public works projects) and stifles the growth of capital, productivity, and the economy. Hazlitt wrote his first edition just after the destructive reign of Roosevelt who presided over the greatest destructive measures in US history with his heavy taxation, tarriffs, deficit spending, and regulations. We saw the longest capital destroying Depression in modern history followed by one of the most destructive wars this nations every experienced that sucked capital out of the economy to feed the war through deficit financing. Hazlitt covers both of these types of destruction to the economy successfully. While it appears that war creates capital, this is deceitful.All war does is shift capital from other industries toward the industries that support the war. A further aggrevation of the economy was rationing. With the shifting of capital toward consumption and destruction, rationing of scarce supplies occurred, and guess who was in charge of it? That's right! The government. The result of rationing industries from where capital got shifted to support war industries had their capital stolen, thereby leading to rationing of what was left over in those industries.As these war industries absorbed capital for producing war equipment that gets destroyed, there is insufficient capital reinvested. Conseqently, the entire economy suffered.Then Hazlitt gets into a topic that burns hot today - picking winners and losers among industries and companies. Hazlitt observed the same problem then as exists now with the Obama administration: proping up industries (banks, auto, etc.) at the expense of taxpayers (both individuals and companies). The results is corporate cronyism and corruption. This is how economics and morality get married. In essense, Obama is no different from Clinton in destroying the moral fiber of our nation through the reallocation of wealth and its destruction while he does it. Hazlitt saw that almost 80 years ago and warned us about it.Those who argue against Hazlitt and his economics are really short-sighted in not being able to see all sides of the economic picture. They miss the point of the very simple but powerful illustration Hazlitt provides at the beginning about the broken window. They see only the consumption side (the loss and new replacement that makes it appear that nothing happened) and not the capital side (the siphoning off of capital through destruction so that eventual capital is lost). Hazlitt points out this ignorance, which makes his message long lasting and popular.Free people do not like to be controlled whether by government, unions (which Hazlitt also addresses), or vandels. All three of these entities not only destroy or reduce capital but also the moral principles behind the creation of capital. They produce nothing because that is not their purpose. Their purpose is destruction and control, the opposite of liberty, moral sentiments (Adam Smith), and productivity that leads to a vibrant economy."

For over sixty years this is the tune Hazlitt has been singing. And surprisingly, it is a tune that still strikes a modern-day chord.Deficit spending, inflation, farm subsidies, trade tariffs--pick your modern day issue and you'll find a chapter or two directed to it here. Looking at each through what some might call an Austrian lens, Hazlitt focuses on their supposed fallacies in an upfront, un-intimidating manner. It makes for an enticing presentation--which is likely the reason for its stunning decades-long resilience--but admittedly, its age is beginning to show.The intricacies of modern finance are not to be untangled here, nor is the role of finance in modern economics even acknowledged. Similarly, though the importance of trade is trumpeted, the complexities of globalization are not to be forecast. For these issues, you'll have to turn to books like Greg Ip'sThe Little Book of Economics: How the Economy Works in the Real World (Little Books. Big Profits)or Alan Greenspan's surprisingly readableThe Age of Turbulence: Adventures in a New World(Tom Friedman'sThe World Is Flat 3.0: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Centuryalso isn't bad, but it is a bit too folksy). Approaching economics from an initial condition of equilibrium also seems a bit flat, if only because it describes an economy that doesn't exist.Hazlitt's prescience regarding the results of unnaturally low interest rates, deficit spending, and government subsidies of the housing market, however, are astonishingly accurate in view of the recent economic malaise. That government subsidized mortgages with little to no downpayment from buyers could lead to a glut of bad loans, an oversupply of housing, and a cancerous malinvestment of capital are lessons we are ruing today and risks he warned of decades ago. That we didn't recognize them sooner supports Mr. Hazlitt's ultimate conclusion that our problems are less economic than political, and, with the rest, makes his short little book on economics exceptionally enticing, if not surprisingly resilient."

Its prose is extraordinarily lucid, its arguments are clear and irrefutable, and its organization and development are superb.I have only two complaints. First: in the Introduction there are a few thinly veiled and unsupported pot shots taken at major economists with whom Hazlitt disagrees (Keynes). Second: The title of the book is misleading. This book is a polemic and not a survey of the field of economics.I should also address the very silly criticisms made against this book by some of the other revewiers. Most of these critical reviewers entirely misunderstand the point of the book. The book is intended as a lucid refutation of certain extremely common anti-capitalist economic fallacies. That is all. Thus, criticisms like ""this book fails to address: game theory, natural monopolies, the pricple-agent problem, labor market friction, some advanced math technique, etc"" are simply irrelevant. It would be an absurd detour were Hazlitt to address those things when they aren't the topic of his book, and aren't relevant to the fallacies he's refuting. None of the fallacies he refutes use game theory, even if economics in general does. And ""this book is simple and doesn't advance economics in any way"" is another ridiculous criticism, because OBVIOUSLY any book entitled ""[subject] in one lesson"" or ""intro to [subject]"" is not intended to advance the state of the science.In its intended purpose, which is to refute certain specific fallacies and in so doing explain a certain kind of thinking, this book succeeds incredibly well."

It was my introduction to critical thinking and it gripped me from page one. The pellucid logic of Hazlitt's demonstration of Frederic Bastiat's ""broken window"" fallacy as the key to understanding the core principles of economics challenged everything I thought I knew (as son of a socialist). I initially resisted his free market conclusions but eventually decided he was right. The ideas he encapsulated so eloquently kept burning in the back of my mind, and I began to understood that freedom was more than just a catalyst of prosperity. I found myself motivated to get a high school diploma and eventually a college degree. (Thanks for the push, Henry!)One might expect the power of such ideas to have a more lasting impact, and for a while it did. The Soviet Union flopped and tyrannies around the world began to fall. Free market ideas made a dramatic comeback in America and it seemed we'd outgrown the need for books like Economics in One Lesson.But here we are in 21st Century riding the political pendulum back toward the Orwellian left: a metastasizing, unelected federal bureaucracy pushing a ""leveling"" regulatory steamroller over our flattened liberties and discarded Constitution; an administration intent on piecemeal nationalization the health care system; a Congress boiling with new laws, new plans for a smothering Beltway governance.That's why like this are timelessly relevant. They are ultimately our only civilized defense against the downhill drift into the abyss of the omnipotent state. And as I can attest, this book may be brief, but it's powerfully persuasive.

No abstract formulas or theory, just straight forward cause and effect, simple deductive reasoning. Originally written in 1946, updated in `62 &`79, the economic policy areas discussed are timeless, i.e., relevant today. Mr. Hazlitt discusses not only the immediate visible effects of implemented legislation and policy, but also the unintended consequences to the community at large, the not so visible effects.I would recommend this book for everyone, from the casual observer to the economic scholar, and (in my opinion) should be required reading for all politicians and policy makers."

Hazlitt's book opened my eyes to an insightful intellectual library that supports free-markets and individual liberty. Economics in One Lesson enlightened me, while it helped develop my economic reasoning. It helped me confirm what common sense told me all along - that a laissez-faire free market is the way to go!While I already had a libertarian bent, this book basically introduced me to the Austrian School of Thought on Economics. The &quot;Austrians&quot; vindicate the market economy's spontaneous order as the surest way to have optimal prosperity, opportunity, and individual liberty for the masses. The verbal logic and reasoning of the Austrian school is generally easy to understand and makes sense to the reader. Needless, to say my interest in the laissez-faire perspective grew - and I read and amassed a library of hundreds of interrelated books on various disciplines from economics to history to political theory. I also recommend any books by other &quot;Austrian&quot; luminaries such as Ludwig von Mises, F.A. Hayek, and Murray Rothbard.

Henry Hazlitt proves in a logical way how war doesn't create prosperity , that tariffs make us collectively poorer, that exports must be paid by imports, why minimum wage laws cause unemployment, and why price fixing never works. In the chapter ""The Broken Window"", the author also explains the importance in economics of seeing not only the immediate and seen effects of a given policy, but also seeing the larger and unseen effects of a given policy.

They force the general taxpayer to subsidize bad risks and to defray the losses. They encourage people to 'buy' houses they cannot really afford. They tend eventually to bring about an oversupply of houses as compared with other things. They temporarily overstimulate building, raise the cost of building for everybody (including the buyers of the homes with the guaranteed mortgages), and may mislead the building industry into an eventually costly overexpansion. In brief, in the long run they do not increase overall national production but encourage malinvestment.""If this was the only sentence in this book our current so-called economists had read, understood and applied when Fannie and Freddie came waddling down the pike, we wouldn't be in the mess we're in today.

Are there benefits in destruction (let it be a humble broken window or a bloody war? Is government spending the solution to unemployment or industries in trouble? Can taxes benefit the economy of a country? Do inflationary policies really encourage a well-functioning economy or are they just a smokescreen to conceal otherwise unpopular decisions? Are all labor union practices truly justified? And, what about tariffs, subsidies, parity prices, rent control, or minimum wage laws? These are the kind of issues the author analyses beyond what you can usually hear, read, or see on the media.Beyond what you may think about the government's role in the economy, whether you agree or not with the author's liberal views, ""Economics in One Lesson"" shows how one should always try to see beyond the obvious and avoid missing the forest for the trees.As the author points out, half-truths presented as complete truths are behind most economic fallacies. Demagogues and 'rogue' economists try to divert our attention by focusing only on the most visible effects of a given decision (or, in the worst cases, on the only effects that should be seen not to discredit an already decided course of action).

This is the one and only lesson presented by Hazlitt in this book. Throughout the remaining chapters, Hazlitt applies this lesson to various economic situations such as minimum wage laws, international tariffs, government subsidies, war economies, government spending, inflation, labor unions, and government price-fixing. Hazlitt presents specific examples of these various situations in which he applies the ""one lesson"".This book has been written in such a way that is free from technicalities while remaining accurate so that it can be easily read and understood by a reader with no previous knowledge of basic economic principles.

He wrote in a no-nonsense style, demolishing seemingly persuasive, highly complex or even tortured arguments in favour of suboptimal economic policies. Much as Copernicus placed the sun, rather than the earth, at the centre of the solar system, thereby greatly simplifying astronomical calculation and eventually enabling Kepler and Newton to explain planetary motion and gravity in simple, eloquent equations, so Hazlitt masterfully simplifies the world of economics, in both theory and practice. Each chapter of Economics in One Lesson is a tour-de-force critique of one or more misguided economic policies. In his own time, using his powerful economic insight, he was able to predict a broad range of future economic developments, including the dollar devaluation and stagflation of the 1970s, the devastating impact of rent control on urban housing, the counterproductive effects of trade barriers and the distorting aspects of many forms of regulation, taxation and government subsidies. Armed with the common sense knowledge explained cogently in this volume, non-economist readers will find they can make much better sense of economic developments and see far easier through politicians' and policy makers' frequently deceptive arguments and false promises.

A vote cast for a politician who promises economic prosperity based on a FLAWED understanding of ""cause and effect"", is a wasted vote and produces disappointing results for us all."

Hazlitt's now renowned treatise originally written in 1946 is lauded by Libertarian stalwarts Ron Paul, Peter Schiff and Lew Rockwell among others. While some of the examples provided in the text may be dated the book is as relevant today as it was when first written. Hazlitt, from a 1940's perspective, takes on many of today's most controversial issues such as government spending, taxes, minimum wage, balance of trade, unions and inflation. In an era of big government, many of Hazlitt's economic lessons come as a breath of fresh air. I highly recommend Economics in One Lesson for those interested in learning about the Austrian School of economics and basic free market priciples."

An idea or political initiative can have a great stated goal such as ""lets pass a law against cigarettes when illegal no one or at least far fewer people will smoke, we will all be healthier, health care cost will go down etc"" this sounds like a great idea but Hazlitt introduces to the equation the problem of unintended consequences. Sure the government can make cigarettes illegal but there are the unintended consequences to this, when ever there is a good people want there will be someone to provide it, much like with illegal drugs today the providers will be violent street gangs, and drug cartels. Street gangs could smuggle tobacco in from other countries or grow it here in America much like what they do now with drugs, the result will be giving them something else they can monopolize the sale of, gives them even more power and money, creates even more violence on the streets, more innocent youths get shot and killed in street gang tobacco selling turf wars etc.I do not recall seeing the particular example of cigarettes in the book but I just decided to brief on a relevant topic today to illustrate the idea of Hazlitt's book.Hazlitt goes through many examples of popular goody goody government initiatives that appear all well and do on the outside but have many honorific unintended consequences.This book will enable you to look at proposed legislation with a completely different set of eyes, seeing through the rhetoric of the stated goal and to the nitty gritty of the likely resultsThis book along with Irwin Schiff's ""the biggest con"" are two of my must haves for anyone pursing self education in free market economics.5 stars"

Well Henry, that's not quite true as we learned from the Japanese. American dollars also work quite nicely for buying American real estate and American businesses. It turns out you can do more with a dollar than buy exports.The author also argues that you can not make money by giving away your products, but you can. All you have to do is force your competition out of business by giving away your product until you establish a monopoly. Then you can charge whatever you like. For all his rhetoric about not being short-sighted, he sure mucks it up himself.Although the author has the occasional valid point, most of his arguments are extremely pro-corporation and anti-labor.

My minor as a PhD student was economics, so I have all the quant-heavy micro, macro, and econometrics. Comparative statics, production functions and all that fun stuff (Chiang, Varian, Judge, Theil, etc.,etc.). I thought this book might be really trivial, but it's not. This book has absolutely none of the quantitative stuff, but it is very heavy on reasoning through economic relationships and effects.This book takes a theme from Frederic Bastiat (that which is seen and that which is unseen) and develops and illustrates it. Basically, Hazlett goes through economic policy arguments and illustrates not only the seen (favorable) effects, but lays out all of the ""unseen"" negative effects. Based solely on an understanding of supply and demand, the fact that resources are scarce, and that people will act to maximize their own welfare, Hazlitt shows how horribly misguided and counterproductive many economic policies are. Although originally written back in 1946 (with lots of references to New Deal programs) it is just as relevant to todays economic policy proposals and arguments.I really can't recommend this book highly enough. It's fun and refreshing for people with an academic background in economics, and at the same time extremely accessible for those who don't. I'm going to see if I can get a bulk deal on a couple of cases to pass out to my students for free.Another reviewer criticized it as partisan or as a ""libertarian manifesto"". No reviewer has actually mentioned an ERROR in it; some people simply don't like the conclusions it draws.

1423,B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,A1RTR66ZBY6T44,Justin W. Thole,3/3,5.0,1313539200,Economics In One Lesson Review,"The book Economics In One Lesson is about economic policies, and how these policies should take into account the effect they will have on everyone involved, not just one group. It also discusses and illustrates how economics should be focused on long term effects, rather than ignoring or overlooking the long term and only focusing on the short term. The author states that the most common fallacy in economics is to concentrate on the short-run effects of policies on special groups and to ignore or belittle the long-run effects on the community as a whole. Throughout the book, the chapters give lessons and examples that bring this one overriding lesson into focus. The author sums up economics in a single sentence: ""The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.""The author discusses the enormous faith many people have in government spending. He writes: ""There is no more persistent and influential faith in the world today than the faith in government spending."" But he quickly points out the fallacy of assuming that things can be fixed if the government just spends more money on a given problem or weakness. A current example of this fallacy in action is the public education system in the United States. In the book by Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity, the author, John Stossel, discusses the public education system in the United States. Many policy-makers and citizens alike have the notion that the best way to improve the public education system in our country is with more money. But time after time, studies and statistics have shown that children aren't getting a better education when more tax dollars are given to the school system. It's been proven that no direct correlation exists between the amount of money allocated to the public school system, and the quality of education a child receives. Yet the mantra is frequently repeated by many: ""Give more money to our school system in order to improve it"" as if this will automatically fix the problems. There are a host of problems with the public education system, one of which is not a lack of funds.The author states that ""The economic goal of any nation, as of any individual, is to get the greatest results with the least efforts. The whole economic progress of mankind has consisted in getting more production with the same labor."" He goes on to write: ""Each of us is trying to save his own labor, to economize the means required to achieve his ends. Every employer, small as well as large, seeks constantly to gain his results more economically and efficiently - that is, by saving labor."" America is a highly technological, highly productive society. America has the highest standard of living in the history of humanity. Technology and innovation is abundant. Unfortunately, a common economic delusion is that machines and technology destroy jobs. If this were true, it could be said then that civilization contributed to unemployment with the first efforts to improve efficiency through labor-saving inventions like the wheel. In a recent speech given by a politician, he suggested that ""we go back to the days of living without ATM machines, because they have destroyed the jobs of many bank tellers."" This illustrates the fallacy of concentrating on the short-run effects of something (implementing ATM machines) on a small group of people (bank tellers) and ignoring the long run positive effects on the community (business and consumers) as a whole. The short-run effect is that fewer bank tellers are needed now that ATM machines are widely implemented and used. However the long-run effects are advantageous to the economy. Who manufactures the ATM machines? Who creates and programs the software used in these machines? Who services them when they need calibration, software upgrades, or repair? ATM machines have created jobs, increased production, and raised the standard of living. They have lowered costs for banks by reducing the amount of wages paid out to bank tellers. In turn, banks have passed these savings onto the consumer. ATM's have also increased our quality of life by making the task of depositing and withdrawing money quicker, easier, and more efficient (fewer lines, no dependence on bank hours, and so forth). The ATM market has increased production and efficiency, and contributed to the expansion of the U.S. economy.In conclusion, I would highly recommend this book. It was very informative and clearly written. The author has a tremendous way of articulating tried and proven economic principles in a straightforward, understandable style. I'm thoroughly convinced that if more politicians and legislators would have followed the common sense economic fundamentals and lessons found in this book, the present state of the U.S. economy would be much healthier and robust."

A deep understanding of economics can be had by reading this book and it will not require an understanding of calculus, or an analysis of complicated mathematical proofs. As the author says, ""When we study the effects of various proposals, not merely on special groups in the short run, but on all groups in the long run, the conclusions we arrive at usually correspond with those of unsophisticated common sense.""Economics in One Lesson was written after the ""new"" theories of economics espoused after the Great Depression, largely by John Maynard Keynes in his book The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money in 1936. Keynes theorized that the cause of the Great Depression was a lack of adequate consumer spending, and that the corrective government policy is for the government to simply make up for that lack in consumer spending by increasing government spending. Economics in One Lesson clearly points out the fallacies of such thinking.A summary of the ""one lesson"" is encapsulated in this quote from the book:""Many things that seem to be true when we concentrate on a single economic group are seen to be illusions when the interests of everyone ... are considered. To see the problem as a whole, and not in fragments: that is the goal of economic science.""The author describes the two central errors that occur and damage our overall economy because policy makers tend to:1) focus only on particular interest groups to the neglect of others, and2) consider only the immediate consequences of an act or proposal.Next the author applies the lesson to several policies (government spending as stimulus for the economy, minimum wage laws, overgenerous and extended unemployment relief payments, redistributive government policy, consequences of government deficits and debt, inflation, government loans or guarantees of loans) and shows the long-term, overall disastrous effects of these policies.Consider the policy idea of government guarantee of mortgages. In 1946 the author, prophetically, wrote this:""Government-guaranteed home mortgages, especially when a negligible down payment or no down payments whatever is required, inevitably mean more bad loans than otherwise. They force the general taxpayer to subsidize the bad risks and to defray the losses. They encourage people to ""buy"" houses that they cannot really afford. They tend eventually to bring about an oversupply of houses as compared with other things. They temporarily over-stimulate building, raise the cost of building for everybody (including the buyers of the homes with the guaranteed mortgages), and may mislead the building industry into an eventually costly overexpansion. In brief, in the long run they do not increase overall national production but encourage mal-investment.""Did the government policy makers who declared that home-ownership is a ""right"", and forced banks to grant mortgages to every living person regardless of their credit worthiness and with virtually no down-payments, foresee the resultant housing market bubble that grew from the 1970's through 2008 when the bubble finally burst? Did they consider the long-term results of their policies, or did they just see the Pollyanna good they thought they were doing for the people ""buying"" homes they couldn't afford and would eventually not pay for. We now have a higher than ever before glut of housing on the market (many such homes stand vacant), more foreclosures in process and yet to begin the process, housing starts for new construction will likely not recover for years, many more mortgages are ""underwater"", and a huge fall in the home values of virtually every American. What a prime example of do-gooder government policy in its full glory of unintended consequences.Read this book. We all need to have an understanding of economic principles as our Country faces massive deficits and debt from 80 years of unpaid for government promises that we clearly cannot afford."

Those fallacies all stem from one of two central fallacies, or both: (1) that of looking only at the immediate consequences of an act or proposal, and (2) that of looking at the consequences only for a particular group to the neglect of other groups.""Throughout his work, Hazlitt provides tremendous examples for each of the common myths of bad economists and politicians. The beauty of this work is that Hazlitt explains concepts and observations that appear to be complex in such simple terms that even the US Congress could understand, such as:""The world is full of so-called economists who in turn are full of schemes for getting something for nothing. They tell us that the government can spend and spend without taxing at all; that is can continue to pile up debt without ever paying it off because `we owe it to ourselves' [but] ultimately every dollar of government spending must be raised through a dollar of taxation.""Other truths that Hazlitt espouses seem to be common sense, unless of course you are an elected official:- ""Taxation for public housing destroys as many jobs in other lines as it creates in housing.""- ""The government spenders forget that they are taking the money from A in order to pay it to B.""- ""Government lenders will take risks with other people's money (the taxpayers') that private lenders will not take with their own money."" (e.g. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac)- (Government lenders) ""will throw the available capital into bad or at best dubious projects."" [e.g. A.I.G. and the Wall Street bailouts]- ""If the loans we make to foreign countries to enable them to buy our goods are not repaid, then we are giving the goods away. A nation cannot grow rich by giving goods away. It can only make itself poorer,"" and losses will be paid by increased taxes on everybody.Hazlitt provides a terrific example of economics using initially Robinson Crusoe, then Swiss Family Robinson, and finally modern society concluding that ""everything, in short, is produced at the expense of forgoing something else."" He provides a detailed, yet concise explanation of the supply chain, subsidies, unions, price controls, and wages offering great clarity in this statement: ""In an exchange economy everybody's money income is somebody else's cost. Every increase in hourly wages, unless or until compensated by an equal increase in hourly productivity, is an increase in costs of production.""One of the final sections of this book focuses on the dangers of inflation and the theory of the Keynesians, who have contributed so significantly to the current fiscal mess in Washington D.C. ""The more sophisticated advocates of inflation, in brief, are disingenuous. They do not state their case with complete candor; and they end by deceiving even themselves. They begin to talk of paper money, like the more naive inflationists, as if it were itself a form of wealth that could be created at will on the printing press. They even solemnly discuss a ""multiplier,"" by which every dollar printed and spent by the government becomes magically the equivalent of several dollars added to the wealth of the country."" Yet the fictitious multiplier doesn't. It is merely results in a larger debt that must be repaid through heavier taxes. And continuous injections of new money lower the purchasing power of everyone. Sadly, Hazlitt's observation that government has nothing to give, without first taking it away from someone else, has not yet been learned by the American taxpayer.Hazlitt's writing on secondary consequences of fiscal decisions is brilliant and as applicable today as it was when first written.Tea Party Revival: The Conscience of a Conservative Reborn: The Tea Party Revolt Against Unconstrained Spending and Growth of the Federal Government"

Clark,5/6,5.0,1254441600,A life-changing (or at least mind-changing) book,"I read this book as a college grad fairly ignorant of economic matters. It completely changed my world view. Perhaps that sounds hyperbolic, but the common-sense lessons about human thought and action in this small, easily digestible book have materialized in virtually every aspect of my life, from the obvious, such as my views on political policy, to the obscure, such as my relationships and my satisfaction with my own choices. Hazlitt is never heavy-handed; he come over as extremely objective because he doesn't need to convince anyone of his views. He is confident that anyone who takes the time to read, consider, and understand true economics would be hard-pressed to reject the logical conclusions he offers.The book essentially springs from the premise that economic fallacy results from considering the effects of a policy or action only on a specific group or over a short period of time. From this he goes on to explain how such fallacies have invaded every single sphere of public policy. While before I vaguely opposed the idea of public works projects, tariffs, and welfare, I had no reasoning to back up my thoughts so I rarely expressed them. Hazlitt's book, instead of arming me with political doublespeak, provided me with the solid theory to truly understand why things that seem hard to argue against are really counter productive. I recommend this book for people who hail from any economic class or political party; it won't offend you, and will do nothing but make you more informed and better equipped to understand the world around you.Comment Comment | Permalink | Why no voting buttons?

However, an industry that goes out of business because the market no longer demands it is not ""unemployment."" The reviewer's quote from the book about ""releasing resources"" explains itself -- employment will simply be shifted to more efficient and needed industries. On the other hand, minimum wage laws increase the cost of labor for employers, reducing the number of other workers they can hire, creating true unemployment.""libertarian polemic"" -- Aside from the fallacy of argument by political labeling, this reviewer makes a point worthy of consideration -- markets aren't always rational. This is true, and we see plenty of irrational behavior, particularly in the short run. However, it has been shown time and again that the market behaves largely rationally over the long run, which is the time period that counts. Producers which truly provide demanded value are rewarded. The tech sector is a good example -- all these computers, software and communications infrastructure streamlines operations in all industries, and the nerds are handsomely rewarded for it. If markets were primarily irrational, we would not have the propserity we have today. Irrationality is the exception, not the rule.So my review. I'm an undergrad at an institution with a highly regarded economics program, and though my major isn't economics, I took some classes in that department to help fulfill my humanistic ""artsy"" requirement -- though at my school, economics instruction is heavily calculus-based. While many of the arguments in Hazlitt's book jibe with the results of the math I learned (most significantly that a price floor, like a minimum wage, creates a shortage), I only learned what everything meant conceptually, in plain English, by reading the book. Hazlitt also does a great job explaining the connection between the effect of artificial price and quantity controls on individual consumers/producers and the behavior of the economy as a whole -- something altogether lacking in the untenable but popular separation of macro from microeconomics. In fact, Hazlitt pointed out that consumers are really producers, that demand and supply are two sides of the same coin, something that my teachers never bothered to illuminate in class. You produce what you need in exchange for what you consume. You export what you produce so that you may import what you consume. In the end, as Hazlitt himself notes, it's all common sense.Overall, this book is a really great supplement to an economics education, and I recommend it highly to fellow students."

Hazlitt repeatedly illustrates, in clear and understandable language, why economic agendas which focus on beneficiaries only soon cause more harm than good. Here Hazlitt discusses an array of topics from tariffs, minimum wage, &quot;full employment,&quot; the effects of machinery on employment, government price fixing, rent control, and others.&quot;Economics in One Lesson&quot; has been revised over many years and was originally written over 50 years ago, but amazingly, the very topics he discusses can be found regularly on the nightly news, in newspapers, or discussed among politicians. Hazlitt believes that although economists are largly in agreement with what the government and unions should and should not do, he feels that we've learned very little. Fortunately, Hazlitt has left us a concise book that explains how we can really benefit society in a sound economic way. Recommended!"
1434,B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,A3KDGJX43RU5MK,D. W. MacKenzie,14/16,4.0,1208044800,How to Learn Opportunity Cost,"Economics in One Lesson is a clear and concise explanation of opportunity cost and price incentives. This book is extremely useful as a supplemental text. The reason why is that most modern economics textbooks pass over opportunity cost too quickly. The basic idea of opportunity cost is easy, but students need to see how the opportunity cost concept applies universally.One way to learn opportunity cost is to read Cost and Choice, by JM Buchanan. Cost and Choice is a great little book, but it does not work well for an intro class. Bastiat wrote some classic essays on opportunity cost, but his work could be seen as a little dated. Of course, opportunity cost is itself timeless, but Bastiat aimed at explaining the general applicability of opportunity cost reasoning to a nineteenth century audience.Economics in One Lesson is a modern restatement of Bastiat's essays. Hazlitt writes to counter mid twentieth century Keynesian fallacies. This is an important aim. All to many of us believe that disasters like 9-11 and Katrina created jobs. Too many of us fail to see that the labor and capital that goes into reconstruction has forgone alternative uses. Too many of us believe that capital itself causes unemployment by replacing labor. Labor saved by capital has alternative uses. Even some economists can benefit from reading this book (if they have an open mind) because too few of us see how government spending and credit expansion can displace and distort private sector spending. This is not to say that the free markets never have any slack or are perfect, but the Old Keynesian belief that activist fiscal and monetary policy can permanently increase real GDP is not well founded. Any New Keynesian will tell you that Hazlitt was right about the Old Keynesian economic program.Hazlitt also does fine explaining the basics of price incentives and price and wage controls. Many people will object to what Hazlitt writes about wage and price controls on ideological grounds, but his reasoning is sound. Even pro-minimum wage economists like David Card and Alan Kreuger admit that large increases minimum wage rates must cause increased unemployment. This is a basic lesson of economic theory.The critics of this book generally do not know what they are talking about. Sure Hazlitt does not discuss externalities or asymmetric information, but EIOL is not a comprehensive text, it's a primer on opportunity cost and price/wage controls. Keynesian critics will find fault in its discussions of unemployment, but the fact of the matter is that virtually all economists now reject the Keynesian paradigm that Hazlitt attacked in 1946, including contemporary self described Keynesians. Hazlitt is second only to Bastiat in explaining the general applicability of opportunity cost reasoning in an entertaining fashion, and his book is more up to date. All first year economics students should read Economics in One Lesson."

I read it all in about six-hours.For the very impatient, I would suggest they start with the second last chapter to get the big picture, and then read it from the start for explanation, examples and detail.For further reading and study, I would recommend: 'Capitalism: A Treatise on Economics by George Reisman'"
1436,B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,A2LONX7E5LHCJE,"D. S. Heersink ""D. Stephen Heersink""",21/26,5.0,1122681600,Best Single Work on Economics,"This is a marvelous, easy-to-read, and alarming short book. As I read through the consequences of all the tinkering government has done to our ""mixed"" economy, I grew increasingly alarmed at governmental intervention in every domain of our lives, both private and economic. As Hazlitt demonstrates in chapter after chapter, too little attention is paid to the long-term consequences of economic and political decisions. Over and over again, special interests get their way over the common good. When government steals from the taxpayer to reward special interests, the consequences are more like dominos than a straight win-lose transaction. It's time we all took long-term consequences into consideration before more damage is done.Take for example the ""energy"" bill that, as I write, passed Congress. With more than $10B in ""financial incentives,"" ""tax breaks,"" and ""direct subsidies"" to oil producers, all this measure does is (1) further increase our dependence on oil, (2) continue our reliance on foreign imports, and (3) further delay the time when alternative fuels are used to replace polluting gases into the environment. What's temporarily good for the oil companies is not good for the rest of us over the long haul. So, this ""energy bill"" will take $10B out of taxpayers' pockets and line the oil companies pockets so that the cost of gasoline will go down. Does this make sense? We pay either way, obviously.Take another example: Rent control. I live in a city that has had it for over 20 years. Not one new apartment complex has been built in all those years. Not one! In addition to rent control, the city has imposed a moratorium on houses over three-storeys tall. While population is exploding, housing is scarce and affordable only to the extraordinarily wealthy. Meanwhile, I pay half the rent my neighbor next door pays, but I couldn't afford to ""move up"" because there are no new apartments to choose from! They also are occupied by ""sitters"" under rent control. The poor have already moved out, and now there's an exodus of the middle class. San Francisco is only for those under rent control or the very wealthy who can afford million-dollar homes. All because of two policies meant to help the public: (1) Rent control, and (2) building moratoria.Capitalism, obviously, is not a perfect system, but it certainly is the best system compared to the alternatives. Hazlitt, while showing the deficiencies of the alternatives, does not address some of the crucial problems with capitalism itself. Take for example wealth. The rich capitalist can afford to take risks, while the middle class can't afford much risk at all, and the poor are lucky to survive. How does one break out of the vicious circle of haves and have nots? Otherwise, the rich stay rich, the poor stays poor, and everyone remains financially the same. Only venture capitalists, who already have the money, can offer those who don't some chance of improving their lot. Is this the only way to get ahead?Even with questions like these unanswered, this is an important book and a critical read for every citizen. We all need to think ""ahead"" and not just think provincially. We must think of the ""domino"" consequences of all our temporary fixes. They usually beget more problems than they solve. Hazlitt tackles them all: Public works, taxation, foreign aid and ""credit,"" bureaucracy, spread-the-work schemes, the export-import disputes, tariffs, pricing parity, saving obsolete industries, ignoring the pricing system, stabilizing commodities, minimum wage, inflation, and others. All under 200 easy-to-read pages. Highly recommended."

Each subject, however horrifying they may sound to a first-time reader, is dealt with in such a way that it becomes wholly intelligable.Take, for example, Hazlitt's introduction to the field of minimum wage laws: &quot;We have already seen some of the harmful results of arbitrary governmental efforts to raise the price of favored commodities. The same sort of harmful results follow efforts to raise wages through minimum wage laws. This ought not to be surprising, for a wage is, in fact, a price.&quot;Here Hazlitt begins a topic by reference to one that has already been mastered. He shows not only the indirect relationship to what was earlier learned (both involve an arbitrary use of government power) but also the direct relationship (a wage is a different way of saying a price -- it is the price paid for labor). Later on, he will show that both of these relate back to the lesson learned in chapter one.Because of this manner of treating economics, the book reads like a marvelous integration of economic thought (in fact, that's exactly what it is) and it's accessible to the average reader.More than that, it's exciting. After reading it, I was left eagerly wanting to know more about economics -- not in the manner of a student who learns a subject for the mere fact of learning it, but because I saw the relevance that it had in the politics of today, in the food I ate this morning, the clothes I will wear tomorrow and in the quality of music or literature I can enjoy at some future date.Now, assuming you value your life (along with all that makes it enjoyable) as I do, it is safe to say that you'll love this book.You won't know everything about economics after reading it, but you'll have a solid foundation for learning more in the future. (And you'll want to know more because you'll see its relevance.) If such is the case -- as I am tempted to say will surely be -- I suggest progressing to any of the works of VON MISES or a work by Frederic Bastiat called ECONOMIC SOPHISMS. For grounding your economic thoughts in a sound philosophical base, I also recommend reading Rand's CAPITALISM: THE UNKNOWN IDEAL."
1438,B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,A1PWAWXS367JUD,R,9/10,4.0,1154822400,A good first brush with correct economic thought,"THIS SHOULD BE MANDATORY READING FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS STUDYING THE WW2 ERA and others who have never been exposed to economics but are interested. I highly encourage parents and teachers to add it to their childrens' curriculums.That said, this book is not perfect. Rather than ""Economics in One Lesson"", it is more like ""A Series of Economic Fallacies Debunked."" Hazlitt does not lay out the basic principles of economics, which could be done in about 5 lessons: 1)self interest, 2) TANSTAAFL (opportunity cost), 3) division of labor, 4) maybe price equilibriums/supply&demand;, and 5) maybe something else. Instead, he riffs on some common misconceptions.The problem with that is:- The fallacies he addresses are not as commonly espoused today as they were in the recent past (WW2 era). Today's interest-party-backed fallacies are much more insidious.Since the 80s free-market capitalism has become more mainstream, so it may be better for novices to dive into a book that lays out the principles of economics as above. Or maybe a more contemporary econ topics book like Steve Levitt's Freakonomics.- By not laying out the principles backing his critiques, Hazlitt may not have much power to convince those who are misguided (as evidenced by the negative reviews here).A few comments on those reviews:""A look at any number of third world countries will reveal the true outcome of relinquishing government and social controls of the economy."" - ironically true.""Read the rabid ranting temper tantrum of the one reader who amazingly was accepted to the University of Chicago"" - as a Chicago grad, I can assure you the reputation of some of its professors is not deserved by all of them, nor by all of their students.To the guy defending the factory-bombing fallacy: please google ""opportunity cost.""To those saying ""this book is against modern economics, right-wing, etc"": no.

What is the one lesson that rules them all? It is this: The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.Imagine that! Tracing the consequences of economic policies all throughout an economy and not only focusing on its immediate, short-term effects! Every politician who actually cares about this country and wants to help it, needs to memorized that sentence and live it! They won't. It won't get them re-elected. Short-term benefits with long-term harms are what got us where we are today. The American people continue to keep themselves economically ignorant and re-elect whoever promises to bring home the bacon. Welcome to 14.4 Trillion in debt and unemployment through the roof. Can you say, ""long-term harms are coming home to roost?""After introducing the one lesson early on in the book, Hazlitt proceeds to give example after example of this principle in practice. Each one is clearly stated and well-argued. That the book was originally written in 1946 amazes me. The prescience of the author is why the book is just as relevant today.Hazlitt concludes with, ""The analysis of our illustrations has taught us another incidental lesson. This is that, when we study the effects of various proposals, not merely on special groups in the short run, but on all groups in the long run, the conclusions we arrive at usually correspond with those of unsophisticated common sense. It would not occur to anyone unacquainted with the prevailing economic half-literacy that it is good to have windows broken and cities destroyed; that it is anything but waste to create needless public projects; that it is dangerous to let idle hordes of men return to work; that machines which increase the production of wealth and economize human effort are to be dreaded; that obstructions to free production and free consumption increase wealth; that a nation grows richer by forcing other nations to take its goods for less than they cost to produce; that saving is stupid or wicked and that squandering brings prosperity.""It's a breath of fresh air to see that this one lesson supports common sense in the study of economics."

The material is sound enough to serve as an introductory college-level text, while the writing, logic, and language is accessible enough that one need not be a student of economics to find the lessons useful. Hazlitt begins by exposing basic fallacies of taxes, wealth, and government programs and continues by exploring more specific programs such as farm subsidies and tariffs. Hazlitt's thesis is that by focusing only on the short-term effects a particular economic policy has for a certain group one ignores the long-lasting and multi-factorial effects that policy has on any number of unseen groups who are not directly involved in the policy. Beginning with the classic broken window fallacy Hazlitt explains in basic terms how the true effect of some economic programs is to transfer production from more efficient economic sectors to the less efficient, thereby weakening the economy as a whole. Hazlitt's writing is effective and confident without being denigrating to those whom he argues against. Although Hazlitt mentions throughout the text that his purpose was not to bloat the book with charts and statistics, when he employs these sorts of facts to support his arguments his presentation becomes that much the stronger and easier to understand; so, one could wish that he had chosen to use them more often. His logic does not suffer for their absence, though, and Economics in One Lesson remains an excellent, quick read for anyone seeking a greater understanding of basic economic principles."

Henry Hazlitt begins with an example discussed by Frederic Bastiat - the 'broken window fallacy' - from Bastiat's essay 'On What Is Seen And What Is Not Seen'. Bastiat's point, and Hazlitt's, is that much common thinking focuses on visible, short-term results and ignores invisible, longer-term consequences - because the latter often consist of things that did *not* happen.Hazlitt explains this insight and applies it brilliantly to many specific economic issues (inflation, unemployment, price controls, international trade, and others). By the time the reader has completed this book, he or she will be 'thinking like an economist'.Despite the remarks of a previous reviewer, I do not think Hazlitt is 'sarcastic' in this book or has very much in common with novelist Ayn Rand. Miss Rand owed quite a lot to Hazlitt's work, and especially to this volume (which she highly recommended despite some disagreements on particular 'philosophical' points). However, there was no debt whatsoever in the opposite direction."

It can befall every persons wants, needs, dreams, hopes, and in some cases even religion. Ever since high school I have pushed myself in following a business career and even now I'm striving for a degree in Economics. I have always pushed myself to create new techniques in finding that simple solution to money, but have always come up short.Henry Hazlitt's Economics in one Lesson could not have a better book for me to stumble upon. In the beginning of his insightful book he stated his theory, or lesson as he would put it. This simple lesson completely blew away the average persons thinking on the whole economical thought. He basically described how one needs to think out of the box. What I mean by this is that one should not see economics at the immediate but at the long term effects of any act or policy, also not to just follow the consequences of one group but for all groups.As I read through the chapters of Mr. Hazlitt's book, I read about hundreds of fallacies in the everyday business world. He had seemed to bend all beams of light to a completely new perspective. The one thing that I enjoyed most about this book was the author's way to seem to totally contradict the average mans thought on the topic. He had credible thoughts and sources to back his lessons up. He described how our world works in favor of itself. He used an excellent example of this with his ""broken window"" theory. A baker's window is broken in by a stone that a kid threw at it. The baker has to spend money on the window which benefits the glass maker. This same money was supposed to go towards a new suit. All that is seen here is that the baker spent the money on a window and not a suit. If you were to think out of the box you would also see the unseen. The baker now cannot buy his suit which makes the tailor that much poorer.Hazlitt described in one simple equation how taxes discourage production while also showing how our government is not entirely effective. Let's say our national income is two hundred billion dollars and government taxes produced only fifty billion dollars of that. This means that only 25% of the national income was being transferred from private to public purposes. The government spenders forget that they are taking money from A in order to pay it to B. Perhaps they see A but because B is soon to be able to live a much more lavish life by all the money transferred to him; they forget the effects on A. B is seen; A is forgotten.A second instance of the author's brilliance is his discussion on inflation. As he points out, inflation has led to nothing but economic disaster. It encourages squandering, gambling and reckless waste of all kinds. It's the creator of fascism and communism and leads men to demand totalitarian controls. People tend to confuse money with wealth, and feel that if they had twice as much money that they would be twice as rich. Hazlitt proves this to be a nave thought. The total quantity of money multiplied by its velocity of circulation must always be equal to the value of the total quantity of goods bought. Double the quantity of money and you exactly double the price level and so on and so forth.As you can see, Henry Hazlitt used a completely different form of thinking on Economics. He had just not focused on the current situation but instead the long term effects. He used the most basic form of scientific reasoning when creating his ideas on the subject, and that is why I believe he has made an excellent argument in proving that the current economic standpoint of our world is extremely short from being flawless. Hazlitt covered every topic in the economic world by totally revising it to a more reasonable perspective, one that was otherwise unrealized. He created his ideas by incorporating historical instances with current issues and then unraveling it to show its trend and effect on everyone's life. Henry Hazlitt wrote this book more than 50 years ago yet it still covers the very topics in today's newsstands and news channels. He has created a simple guide that explains how we can improve our very way of living by channeling new methods into our economical standpoint. In conclusion, I feel that Henry Hazlitt has effectively stated his argument in a strong, clear, and fair manner in his book."

It is interesting that the author describes the housing bubble which he did not live to see (this has been pointed out by a number of other reviewers), but what I find just as interesting, the section on imports and exports shows very clearly why making the USD the world's reserve currency has had (and continues to have) a destructive effect on the US economy (since it creates an impetus to hoard dollars [exactly what the chinese are doing] as opposed to spending them on US-produced goods).What I also find interesting (and depressing) is that a lot of the reviews of this are ""religious"": look at all of the one-star reviews -- none of them have any logical objection to Hazlitt, but they all say that they are (in effect) religiously opposed to it. Until people (and Amazon book reviewers are probably slightly more sentient than average) learn to think, we will continue on the current road to ruin.(the above was written before I had actually finished the book: now that I have I am even more impressed, because the last three chapters, on Inflation, Savings, and Lessons learned are eerily relevant to the current crisis, and the last chapter is particularly depressing, since, despite Hazlitt's hope, the governments STILL are going on their merry way making things worse)."

Currie,13/16,4.0,1022198400,Somewhat Simplified but Very Pertinent!!,"It's been about six months since I last read Hazlitt's forcelfully argued little monster. The ideas in it, though, are never far from my mind. More accurately, every time I think about the current state of the political economy, I get the strong urge to buy it and ship it to a senator. Maybe they'll learn something!Although it's title is misleading (not an economics intro, but a manifesto), Hazlitt's book explains in simple language the flaw in todays macro-economic thinking. Money can not be created when taking from source A only to give to source B. Source B only gains by source A's corresponding loss. Sounds simple, right. Then why are we convinced that tariffs, minimum wage, and the federal reserve (GASP!) are doing anything positive by operating on that theory. When we force the minimum wage up, all we are doing is shifting the burden to the consumer by upping what the employers products cost to make. As soon as the wages go up, so do prices. Once the prices are raised, that whole industrys prices go up (because they can) and everyone pays more INCLUDING the employees you thought you were helping. Hazlitt doesn't stop there, he gracefully applies the theory to a plethora of situations.Although somewaht oversimplified (200+ pages) and certainly biased (free market) This book offers us a good theory, good argument and- suprisingly rare in econ texts- an overall enjoyable read. The only two real problems I see are: 1) As Hazlitts arguments all stem from this anti-distribution theory, the book gets repititious and you'll probably get the drift by page 120, and 2)At certain points, Hazlitt fails to distinguish between 'pecuniary wealth' and 'value wealth.' Wealth in dollars and wealth in utility are two different things. If we shift some money from source A (a dormant bank account) to source B (a compnay building a bridge to allow new commerce) Hazlitt argues that all we've really done is shift a static dollar amount. Of course the bridge when built will bring an escalation in commerce that will likely maximize it's use. While in the end, I think that Hazlitts argument, that money should not be forced into source B's hands by artificial distribution, Hazlitt doesn't pay enough attention to pecuniary v. real value. Still, this book is a great polemic, showing us why distribution tends to have the reverse effect. BUY I...if only so you can puke next time you watch the senate activities on C-SPAN."

Hazlitt refers often to ""The Forgotten Man"", a book by William Graham Sumner published in 1883 which went into much detail on how government policy will always favor the politically connected at the expense of the powerless. Politician A passes a law to benefit constituent B at the expense of constituent C (The Forgotten Man).

Hazlitt explains what happens when one or a few people try to make a decision for the masses, like an import quota or price ceiling.It's interesting to me that a person can understand and politically agree that intervention in foreign economies, like an embargo or military invasion, will result in unintended consequences that are bad for most everyone (at least us who pay for it) but cannot accept that intervention in our domestic economy has unintended consequences. Some may say these are acceptable, but when the actual effects of polices like welfare, oil and coal subsidies, weapons production, FDIC insurance and anti-trust laws are honestly examined, people deny it.If you disagree with people who want a smaller federal budget, I still recommend reading this book so you understand what you're actually disagreeing with."

1481,B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,A9LIET7K21PAO,Thomas Stamper,9/11,5.0,988675200,A Lesson Learned,"This is a book that looks at the shadow side of government altruism in economics. Henry Hazzlit's main thesis is that when we focus our economic policy on a particular group, we somehow ignore other groups that are adversely effected. A high tariff on cars may help manufacturers of cars, but it hurts those who buy cars. Artificially boosting milk prices may make the farmer feel rich, but it's out of the pockets of the milk buyer. Since there are far more consumers than producers, the special attention harms more people than it helps.In essence, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. The government focuses on paying Paul, but not stealing from Peter. Hazzlit argues that both deserve their due. Usually Paul is big and easy to see, but even if Peter is a conglomeration of people and hard to find, he still exists and he is still being hurt. He also argues that Job Works programs like the New Deal are more harmful than helpful, because they absorb resources that could be more productively used in the free market. People are a component of productivity, argues Hazzlit, and when their use is diverted to inefficient means, the loss of productivity costs every taxpayer and citizen a better life.Hazzlit gets a lot done in this short volume. He uses the kind of common sense that seems to be absent from most economic theories and his writing style is very easy to follow."

Much of the book is a breezy, but substantiated rebuttal of the many flaws in economic polocies. The author makes a very readable case for the removal of tariffs and subsidy crutches for sick industries. But the author pays no attention to human-fallibility factor in ecomonics. The author notes that sick-industries need to die out to provide breathing space for more nascent ones. This, according to the author, is also essential for freeing workers for the new industry. This statement does not say anything about the disruptive nature of this change or the difficulty and time-consuming nature of such a transition. Skills become obsolete in a matter of a few years or even months in the current marketplace and re-learning new skills at a considerably advanced age is no small issue. A basic comprehension of this fact and its treatment is missing from the book, but this is no fault of the author. The book was written in a time when the only major transitions were from the cottage-textile industry to the industrial, and the sunset of the agricultural economy. All said, this book is still the best introduction I've read. Understand the basic concepts as simple parables. The beautiful complexity and nuanced points can be explored later"

Hazlett was a classical liberal who railed continually against the reigning ideology of massive state intervention. Hazlett wrote Economics in One lesson in 1946, and was a weekly columnist for Newsweek for the next two decades. He wrote many books, but Economics in One Lesson has been the most popular, and is a real classic. Hazlett palled around with all the free-market gurus, including Hayek and von Mises, but he wrote in a simple and engaging style that was unknown in the Austrian school of economics.Hazlett's `one lesson' is actually one sentence: ""The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consist in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups."" (p. 17) The book consists of applying this principle to 25 areas of economic policy. Several of these areas involve correcting very common economic fallacies, including the introduction of labor-saving machinery, tariff protectionism, saving inefficient industries, and government price-fixing.Some of his applications, however, seem less clear-cut. Several chapters deal with a critique of Keynesian aggregate demand policies. While such a critique might be in order, Hazlett never addresses the problem of underutilized resources and the role of Keynesian policies in restoring full employment. This may be because the free-market analysis of the business cycle and depression cannot be handled by Hazlett's single principle. I believe he should have added that the market tends to full employment unless impeded by government interference and widespread anti-competitive collusion.Others of his applications do consider the long-term costs of interventions, such as rent control and minimum wage laws, but does not seriously engage the reader in balancing the costs and benefits. My own reading of the matter is that rent control has disastrous long-term consequences for a community but might be salutary for a short period of time while other measures to deal with the inequities of the housing market are put into place, but minimum wage laws have no long-term deleterious effects, except of course the possibility of entailing higher unemployment rates among the unskilled.If you read the financial pages of the Wall Street Journal or The Economist, this book may not tell you anything you don't already know. But you might recommend it to your uniformed Uncle Ernie, or to your children who never get beyond the sports pages of the local newspaper. Tell them to take it all with a grain of salt, though; there's more to economics than this volume dreams of."

Hazlitt does not deal in economic details here. Intead, Economics in One Lesson covers more useful ground for the average person: it cumulatively teaches us how to think logically about economic issues. And, of course, how you think is the basis for what you think. Even the casual reader will take away an ability to spot economic silliness, many of which spring from the same bad premises, the same elementary blindness to cause-and-effect. Economics in One Lesson provides the type of knowledge that stays with you for a lifetime."

When I started reading this book, I was very curious to know the lesson the author is trying to teach in this book, and it is just not about demand and supply which many other academic economic books trying to teach you.The author provides good insights into the consequences of the vote-bank policies framed by politicians and bureaucrats in the various governments around the world. The reader can get fair understanding of the effects to the public by the taxation of government, and different policies like trade barriers, minimum wage law, regulatory policies and more importantly effects of inflation and government policies to cause and contain inflation.Common words like credit, spending, savings, investment are explained adequately to understand their effects on the production and individual. As author himself points out in the last chapter, though not many of these lessons are not followed by politicians around the world even now, this book is must read for them and for public to understand the repercussions of policies introduced by the government and to provide long term solutions to the public welfare."

The author believes that the less interference in economic systems there is the better the economic system runs. He is against make work schemes, excessive taxes, public works, tariffs, a minimum wage, and unions. He is even critical of Social Security. This book was written originally in 1946 so there is no talk of the issue of Globalization and the numbers used are smaller than we are accustomed to, but otherwise it talks about timeless issues. I think it is important to remember that there are other ways of thinking about economics that are not so extreme in their opposition to public works, unions and a minimum wage. I also think that, although the market does correct itself without intervention and therefore the overall arguments of the author are correct, wages, for example, would be a lot lower if we did not have a minimum wage. Many minimum wage jobs require no skills and therefore there are lots of people to fill them so there is no competition for labor and therefore no incentive to offer higher wages. This book left me wanting to read more about economics, not just for more of the author's point of view, but also for opposing points of view."

Hazlitt's arguments are based on (1) a real understanding of economics and (2) facts, including that socialism has been an abject failure where ever it has been tried. In contrast, the arguments of modern liberals are based on emotions and are devoid of facts and of thinking about the world as it is.I can tell you that this is one of the very best books that has ever been written on economics."

There is very little (none at all, IIRC) in the way of empirical data, for example, all of the lessons are in the form of ""worker A produces product Z,"" that type of thing. Which is very useful for teaching concepts and relations. This book is masterful at getting you to *think* like an economist, which many people can't do (even some economists) just from reading a book on economics. By stripping each lesson to its bare, abstract essentials, you can't help but see the underlying principles at work once you finish this book. What you learn here you will use while reading other econ texts, and in your own observations of the world around you.This is a landmark primer and my only real problem is that the author is defiantly Austrian school and when he tackles Friedmanesque monetary policy I don't think he gets it right--like many other econ writers he seems to be attacking a second-hand version of Friedman, and not Friedman's actual teachings.

They are especially advisable to those that want to understand conceptually, in a clear language, some of the inner workings of national microeconomics. One important remark is that the book focuses mainly on microeconomics, (explaining, for example, some effects of prices, consumers/producers behavior, etc) rather than on the big macroeconomics (balance of payments, growth, etc) or international economics issues (trade, FDI, etc).I like the point regarding one of the main troubles of modern-day economists: the fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences...I think this not only is true but also applicable to other arenas, like politics. On the other hand, I think the author is too one-sided in his libertarian approach.

Timely.,"ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON is an essential work by Henry Hazlitt, of the Austrian school of economics. This piece is well-written, clear, simple and powerful. While it appeared first in 1946 (this edition was updated in 1979) the principles are as relevant today as they were then.The book is intended to emphasize general economic principles and ""the penalties for ignoring them"". Indeed, issues of inflation, deficit spending, commodity pricing, corporate profits, exports and taxes are very much with us today and look in our future.Economics, Hazlitt states, is the science of seeing both general consequences and secondary consequences. While much is made of the former, little is discussed of the latter and therein lies the danger. Government cannot give to one person or group without first taking from another. It creates nothing of value in that giving but in the taking it diminishes and discourages productivity and administers a negative effect on production and the creation of wealth. There is no justice in redistribution by force.Hazlitt writes profoundly of the dangers of inflation. He says, ""...all government spending must eventually be paid for out of the proceeds of taxation; that inflation itself is merely a form, and a particularly vicious form, of taxation"". Also, ""Inflation plants the seeds of fascism and communism. It leads men to demand totalitarian controls. It ends invariably in bitter disillusion and collapse."" Strong stuff.On bureaucracy: ""The bureaucrats do not understand the quasi-automatic system of the market, they are always disturbed by it. They are always trying to improve it or correct it, usually in the interests of some wailing pressure group.""Hazlitt has a gift for making the complex, simple and the abstract, concrete. This book is particularly well-written. In the current debates in Washington, D.C. Hazlitt's voice is one which needs to be heard above the shouting. It is the voice of reason, responsibility and experience. We would be wise to heed that voice."

Juniper,38/165,1.0,1217721600,"poorly written and organized, and generally disappointing","Based on other people's reviews, I thought this would be a fairly straightforward book that a person with a graduate degree but no background in economics (such as myself) would find easy to understand. That was definitely not the case, for a number of reasons.First, the writing is not at all impressive. I know economists are not reputed to be particularly good writers, but come on, get yourself a good editor! Some of the sentences were so wordy and poorly constructed that I had to read them several times to figure out how the writer would have written them if he knew how to write at all. And THEN I had to figure out what the sentence said in terms of expanding my knowledge of economics. It was tedious, to say the least.Additionally, the organization of the text within the chapters needs a significant amount of work. The chapters meander; if you are the type of person who likes to organize a chapter's contents into a mental outline as you read, good luck. This author clearly didn't start with an outline, mental or otherwise. It's like he developed each chapter based on chats he had in his living room, which he asked someone to transcribe, then chunked up into paragraphs and called it done.The author also doesn't do a good job of explaining what different terms mean. What's the difference between a tax, a tariff, and a duty? Darned if I know, and I read about two-thirds of this book before deciding it definitely wasn't worth my time.I also found the content he describes in his chapters to be somewhat outdated. It's hard to get a grasp of economics when you're trying to relate what you know about how a particular system works in the present to the way he's discussing it as working in the past. As I mentioned, I have no background in economics, so I have no way of knowing whether the particular system he's discussing has undergone a massive overhaul at some point, such that the system he's describing no longer bears any resemblance to the system I know. If you can't figure out how to integrate what you're reading into your existing knowledge base, you can't expect to expand your knowledge base.I also wish the author were more up-front about his political bent from the outset, as this would have helped me to interpret what he was saying in the context of my own political views.Overall, I do not recommend this book at all. Maybe I'd have a different take if I had read it for a class I was taking, so that the instructor could fill in the blanks and help put certain things into context. But just reading it on my own, with no background in economics to draw on, was pointless.I'm going to try naked economics next. Reviews seem to indicate that it's written by an economist who can actually write."

But this book is basically a libertarian manifesto shouted really loudly, with no objective evaluation in sight. It is NOT adequate substitution for an economics course, as I hoped it would be.The claim on the back of the book that it is written ""objectively and impartially"" is completely ridiculous; Hazlitt's approach is inflammatory and dogmatic. He compares taxes to ""being robbed"" (96), compares fixed prices to ""coercions"" (116), goes off on melodramatic tangents about evil government controls leading to ""final abandonment of all the traditional liberties we have known"" (123), and basically characterizes any government official as wicked and intending to steal from the masses and head towards ""the seeds of fascism and communism"" (176). Straight out of the cold war.What is peculiar is the fact that he does indeed concede that certain services should be paid with taxes (police, roads, etc.). Why can't those be private too? These implications of Hazlitt's libertarian theories are not explored; they are merely mentioned in apologetic passing. If taxes really are just a power trip, why have them at all? This question remains unanswered.Also, Hazlitt doesn't realize that his claims apply to things that he says, not just other people's purported ""foolery."" He doesn't mind ""Industry X"" dying because it will ""release the necessary capital and labor for the new industries"" (102), but then gets all bent out of shape when another Industry X goes out of business due to minimum wage laws (136) by pointing out the resulting ""unemployment."" Why is unemployment bad here, but okay before? He excuses unemployment in the first case as ""necessary"" and then calls out the second instance as ""condemning the people who worked in that industry"" (136). Which one is it? His decision to hide or showcase negative evidence rests solely on convenience, not truth.Read something else."

For example, in chapter 11 (Tariffs), the author argues that imposing a $5 tariff on an import (sweaters from England) ends up costing the US. Never once does he add the $5 duty received into the equation. How can someone argue against an import tax without analyzing what happens to the revenues from that tax? When the next chapter stated that Exports must equal Imports, I quit reading.In short, I couldn't agree more with the author that all too often the analysis of costs/benefits focus is too narrow. Yet, in trying to expanding the analysis beyond the 'too narrow', the author's analysis in fact is often too narrow."

Careful reading necessary.,"Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead created the monumental work Principia Mathematica (1910-1913), the ambitious and comprehensive effort to provide a detailed reduction of the whole of mathematics to logic. In 1919 Russell was jailed for antiwar protests and while in prison he wrote Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy, a seminal work in the field for more than 70 years.I have devoted substantial time and effort to this 200 page book. Unless you are a student of logic, this book may not be for you. I suggest alternatives below.I stayed the course and worked my way through each chapter, sometimes backing up, and often repeating several chapters before advancing again. Bertrand Russell is admired for his eloquence and style. Nonetheless, I can assure you that a methodical reading will require much effort.I was forewarned. At one point a friend and colleague, a previous professor of mathematics at Texas A&M;, expressed surprise that I was tackling this particular book. He considered Russell's work to be dated and not particularly easy going. I continued plodding along.Russell begins with familiar ground, Peano's effort to derive the entire theory of natural numbers from five premises and three undefined terms (primitives). Russell demonstrates why Peano's approach fails to serve as an adequate basis for arithmetic.In chapter 2 Russell introduces the work of Frege, who first succeeded in logicising arithmetic. We are led to a definition of number: the number of a class is the class of all those classes that are similar to it, or more simply, a number is anything which is the number of some class.The third chapter introduces properties termed hereditary, posterity, and inductive. After some effort, we define the natural numbers as those to which proofs by mathematical induction can be applied. We also learn that mathematical induction is not valid for infinite numbers.Russell now addresses the serial character of natural numbers, a characteristic involving finding or construction of an asymmetrical transitive connected relation.In Chapters 5 and 6 Russell distinguished between cardinal numbers (the earlier definition of number) and relation numbers (also called ordinal numbers). I had difficulty with the interplay between the relations aliorelative, transitive, asymmetrical, square, and connected. For example, an asymmetrical relation is the same thing as a relation whose square is an aliorelative.In chapter 7 I was initially surprised by Russell's assertion that the common belief that the complex numbers include the real numbers, the real numbers include the rational numbers, and the rational numbers include the natural numbers is erroneous and must be discarded.The next thee chapters - infinite cardinal numbers, infinite series and ordinals, and limits and continuity - were more difficult. Eight more chapters follow.Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy is philosophy, logic, and mathematics. It investigates the logical foundations of mathematics. It requires very careful reading.I can suggest alternatives. Howard Eves in his delightful Foundations and Fundamental Concepts of Mathematics offers an excellent chapter titled Logic and Philosophy that compares three approaches - Logicism (Russell and Whitehead), Intuitionism (Brouwer and Heyting), and Formalism (Hilbert's Grundlagen der Geometrie). He also provides in an appendix a short overview of Godel's theorems (1931) which demonstrated that no complete or consistent axiomatic development of mathematics is attainable.I also highly recommend Godel's Proof, a short book by Ernest Nagel and James R. Newman. Godel's Proof demonstrates that Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica must necessarily be incomplete and inconsistent."

But it says little on other philosophical viewpoints (even if only to criticise them). It might be better titled now 'Introduction to a Mathematical Philosophy (Called Logicism)'. We can hardly blame Russell for not knowing about the later developments of the subject (especially Godel), but it is worth bearing in mind that the book was written before some very important discoveries.Like anything Russell wrote, it is a pleasure to read - his writing style is wonderful, and quite extraordinary when one realises how quickly he wrote this book (in prison, too!), but I suspect that for many readers the mathematical content will prove a little tricky to grasp.As a historical document, it is fascinating; as an introduction to mathematical philosophy it is too narrow-minded for 1999."

While the book is not nearly as expansive ad ""Principia Mathematica"" it is a good distillation of the bigger work and provides a great introduction to anyone wishing to explore that work. I recommend this book to anyone interested in formal logic and believe that it should be in the required reading for any formal logic introductory class. Further anyone interested in reading Goedel's work's which expand on Russell's work needs at least to read this work prior to Goedel.

Jump ahead 20 years when there entered men like Godel who showed that the entire endevour was doomed for failure.This is a text written before that fateful discovery, and as such does not have the benefit of the Incompleteness Theorem to flesh out the ideas. As such, most of the material is wanting, at best, to the contemporary reader of mathematics. Adding to this the fact that the communication of mathematical ideas has tremendously changed in the intervening years, and the result is a text that, though one day had great significance, today seems like a much faded phtotgraph from a by-gone era.Maybe this makes the text interesting in itself. However, those readers that wish for a current look at mathematical thought, and an introduction to the philosophy of mathematics may be best served by looking elsewhere."

By learning the basic structure of mathematics, it was much easier to understand what came later. In this book, Bertrand Russell, one of the giants of mathematical philosophy, writes about the subject for a general audience.Russell, known in mathematical circles more for his giant work ""Principia Mathematica"" co-authored by Alfred North Whitehead, does an excellent job in describing the foundations of mathematics for the non-mathematician. It is a difficult task, as it is hard to describe mathematics without using mathematics. While there are some sections where Russell has no choice but to mention some higher-level mathematics, he does so only when necessary and explains it well. Most people with at least some exposure to mathematics will be able to understand it. There are no proofs in the book.As a primer on many of the basic ideas of mathematics, this book is one of the best. Russell was also a great expository writer and he demonstrates that trait here."

What a treatless life it must have been when that wonderful indulgence wasn't available to people of all ages and a delicate combination of of traits: exclusive,romantic,sinfully indulgent,seductive,exotic,delicious,and yet healthful,nutritious and above all else,legal.Although the book concentrates on the chocolate products that were sold in The United States,it brings back fond memories to me , since Canadians were also great lovers of chocolate as well.While we had candy companies of our own here,we also benefited from chocolate products from The British Isles,Europe and of course United States.I was born in 1935 and experienced something that surprisingly was not mentioned in the book .I was just a kid during WWII (1939-1945) and had already developed a love of chocolate and other candy.However;these treats came to a sudden halt because of rationing of sugar,butter,meat,gas,alcohol,as well as a slew of other things. As a result ,we did not see things like bananas,bubble gum,chocolate bars,etc. until the end of the war.However;where there is a will there is a way ;so it became very popular to ""Squirrel Up"" some sugar and making of homemade fudge became very popular. Everybody made it,and fudge sales became very popular to raise money for all sorts of clubs and organizations. But things have changed ,and I haven't heard of anyone ""making fudge"" for years.In Canada,we have always been very fond of candy bars or chocolate bars.There were a large variety and many still can be found today. They were sold by every ""corner store"" the five & dime stores like Woolworths,candy bars at the movie theatres,and even in 1948 or so were 5 Cents each.Boxed candy was also popular but was more for special occasions and/or gifts.A lot of the names mentioned in the book such a Baker's ,Hershey's, Cadbury's, etc. are well known here in Canada.Fanny Farmer is also known ,but not nearly as well as Laura Secord.However;the picture on page 63 really got my interest. This box is identical in every way except for the name and picture.In Canada it is Laura Secord .They are probably the most popular and have their own stores everywhere.Other common names are Nestles, Lowney's,Neilson's .I suspect that there is a lot of common ownership involved.Things are forever changing,I have my doubts if the quality and taste is as good as it used to be,but many products that I remember from many years past are still around such as Oh Henry,Malted Milk (Mars Bars),Coffee Crisp,Crispy Crunch,Hershey's Kisses ,etc.A great book and reminder of the part chocolate plays in all our lives and indulgences."

The author of this book has written a novel that imagines who Erna and Alfreda Anderson were, why they were on the Titanic, and how Erna made it out of the tragedy alive when Alfreda, her relative, did not. The Erna of this book is a ten-year-old dreamer living in the Swedish countryside, often at odds with her realistic, sixteen-year-old sister Alfreda. Their father has been in America for several years, and sends tickets for the family to join them. But their mother must remain behind, so the sisters set off without her, arguing along the way. They board the Titanic in England, and they're on their way. Along the way, they finally manage to become friends. And how Erna survives, and her sister does not, happens in a tragic plot twist that was painful to read and had me nearly in tears. I highly reccomend this book.

Finger won the John Newbery Award in 1925. I didn't know anything about the book when I picked it up other than it's Newbery, but I must say, I was quite pleasantly surprised by what I found.I have always loved Fairy Tales. Like, a lot. If you remember, a few weeks ago I talked about my first experience reading Grimm's Fairy Tales, which helped cement my love for reading them as well. (If you are really interested, click here, and you can go back and read it.) So, imagine my delight when I realized this was a collection of 19 fairy tales recorded by Finger from South America. Although I'm not nearly as knowledgeable about other countries and their rich cultural histories as I'd like to be, I'm always open to learning more. And I think you can learn a lot about a society from their fairy tales and children's stories.This was a real treat for me to read, and one I'm definitely looking forward to adding to my shelves and rereading, not only for myself but also to read to kids. I used to read some of the Grimm's fairy tales to my little brothers as a bedtime story, and I'd love to be able to add these tales to stories I can read/tell to young kids.Although some of these stories might be classified as more mythology than fairy tale, I felt the same way reading these as I did reading the classic fairy tales. There's that sense of magic and possibility, where you know anything can happen, and although things might get a little rough along the way, and there probably won't be super happy ending, the good guys do win in the end.I also noticed that the emphasis of each tale was placed on the struggles of each character rather than the resolution. The ending is always over so quickly. Normally, this is something that is a major no-no in writing, I mean, seriously. Who wants to read a 400 pg. build up to a 4 paragraph resolution?! But it seems to work in fairy tales. The stories aren't about what happens, it's about learning how to get there. We see their struggles, know their challenges and then we get to know they end up relatively alright in the end.This is definitely a book I would recommend. The writing is a little older, but to anyone who is a fan of fairy tales in their original setting (or people who want to write a fairy tale retelling but are wanting new material) this is a great book to read and one that I strongly recommend."

Lappen,6/6,5.0,1121558400,Excellent study,"The title of this book comes from Avot 3:2, in which the deputy high priest said, ""Pray for the welfare of the government, for were it not for the fear of it, people would swallow each other alive."" Indeed, during the chaotic period covered in this excellent study, that is precisely what happened. For the government dissolved, several times over, and the Jewish people were swallowed.The book opens with a brief history of the Jewish people in Ukraine, which surprisingly, goes back 1,000 years. Some 32 pages are devoted to it, before turning to the key events covered in the study. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Jewish population of Ukraine were composed of some 1.9 million souls, who made up more than 8 percent of the Ukrainian population of 23 million.While the Jewish people kept to themselves, and their life in Eastern Europe revolved around the Sabbath and the execution of 613 commandments, respect was alloted to all non-Jews who were required under Jewish law to adhere only to seven basic commandments in order to receive a place in the afterlife.Despite the dissimilarities, there were also many similarities between the cultures, whose cross-cultural exchanges occurred mainly through women.The next several chapters, the bulk of the monograph, cover the establishment of Jewish autonomy in 1917, how this autonomy worked in practice (not well), the pogroms of 1919, and the failure in 1919 of Jewish autonomy and support for the Ukrainian directorate.The fall of the tsar marked an attempt by Ukrainians and Jews to establish a noble experiment in human rights, Abramson writes, ""but despite good will on both sides, the experiment was a disastrous failure.""Even before the pogroms of 1919, there was violence against the Jewish people. The autonomy was marred by nearly 120 attacks on Jewish villages and people in 1917 and 1918. In 1919, the number of attacks totaled more nearly 1,200.Thousands of Jewish lives were lost as a result, and it was no small wonder that the Jewish people of the Ukraine in the wake of this violence turned to the Red Army as their salvation. Irony, too, for the Red Army ended up as much an enemy of the Jewish people as any tsarist regime or the Ukrainian directorate.The book contains many maps of the Ukraine and Pale of Settlement during this period, along with illustrations of important government personages, charts and graphs and the occasional political poster.This is an excellent study for anyone interested in the microcosm of Ukrainian Jewish life during revolutionary times.--Alyssa A.

Great detail and very in depth analysis. Inevitable conclusion is the impossibility of molding an economic system out of a moral philosophy, not just Islam. That is where the problem with traditional Islamic thought arises, for most of its adherents, Islam is not just a set of moral principles but a way of life, dictating every aspect of it. Unavoidably, there was much effort by Islamists to set up a distinct system of banking and economy based on pure Islamic traditions. Prof. Kuran delves into the history of these movements, but he does more than that, he puts all this in cultural and political context. At the end, he bravely expands more on the general failure of Islamic culture and tradition to bring wealth and prosperity to the masses that follow it. Writing is very formal, not the easiest read and surley apporpriate only for the truly intersted in the general topic, but it was well worth it for this reader."

[The author is a libertarian, free-market professor of economics; somehow, he was once the ""King Faisal Professor of Islamic Thought and Culture"" at the Univ. of Southern California (c. 2004), but (c. 2011) he is at the Fuqua Business School at Duke Univ.] This book is a very insightful book regarding how the supporters of ""Islamic Banking"" (""I.B."") have hoodwinked virtually everyone into believing that their anti-interest (anti-riba) concepts are ""superior"" to free-market, pro-interest (pro-riba) theories. The author tries to argue that almost all Muslims fail to understand the hang-up that Prophet Muhammad had against common interest (riba). The author argued that the Quran prohibits ""is the pre-Islamic Arabian institution of riba, whereby a borrower saw his debt double following a default and redouble if he defaulted again. Because it tended to push defaulters into enslavement, riba had long been a source of communal friction (p. 14)."" The author calls this type of riba: ""mammon"" which is not an Arabic term, but is derived from the Christian Bible (see Wikipedia). I am unaware of an Arabic word for the author's contention (besides riba). [Nonetheless, the author details how I.B. or I. Economics is a recently ""invented business"" concept (c. 1970s).] I don't believe that the author really ""proves"" his point regarding mammon/riba with his book - he doesn't cite any Quranic or ahadith references to his contention (not that I recall anyway). Nonetheless, I highly recommend this book for the MANY OTHER topics that the author analyzes in debunking Islamic Economics. A reader should be familiar with free-market concepts: interest theory, P/L, etc. The author discusses how Muslims are trying to 'accept' the use of interest (riba) by calling it instead a ""management fee"" and thereby avoid the opprobrium of 'riba'. Apparently, the author has expanded his arguments against the silliness (okay, anti free-market theories) of Islamic Banking/Economics history in ""The Long Divergent: How Islamic Law Held Back the Middle East."" Islamists are not going to like this book for revealing (shouting out) about I.E.: ""Look, the Emperor (I.E.) is wearing no clothes!"" Essentially, the author is claiming that I.B. is not really ""economics"", but more of a politico-socio (religious) ""feel good"" populist concept ballyhooed by those ignorant of market economics. Islamists realize that acceptance of ""riba"" would contradict Allah's commandment against riba; they all-to-well properly realize: ""accept riba, denounce Allah!"" That is the Islamists' conundrum: how to admit that Allah got it wrong about interest/riba (this would then lead to inquiring if Allah made other errors in the Quran -- or maybe Muhammad misunderstood what Allah was saying). I.E. ranks alongside with those who believe in the ""Flat World Society"" or Stalinism."

The author does not seem well-versed in the history of the Islamic world nor does he understand Islamic economics. He picks up few concepts he thinks will lead him to the conclusions he already knew, so he squeezes Islamic economics into a small area. Contrary to his claims, the main factor leading to the economic decline of the modern Muslim world is the adoption of Marxist ideology - almost every single Muslim country has adopted a Communist regime (leading to political repression by definition). This is not Islamic but rather Jewish Economics. Another factor, among others, would be colonization. Professor Kuran is not an expert on Islam, he would have done better had he sought endeavors in other areas that do not require rigorous empirical testing, perhaps literary work?."

But you cannot &quot;give&quot; someone their own death. Death is a &quot;gift&quot; because it insures our irreplaceableness in God's eyes; it is ours and ours alone. No one can die in my place no more than I can die in theirs. Our willingness to acknowledge this relationship with our own deaths (which above all requires &quot;responsibility,&quot; a term Derrida seems to prefer to &quot;faith&quot;) in turn unites us with God and the self, with the giver and the receiver.I'll admit I hadn't expected a deconstructionist to use terms like &quot;absolute,&quot; &quot;transcendant,&quot; &quot;God,&quot; &quot;self&quot;--in profusion and in earnest. But perhaps Derrida has sufficiently exposed the instability, metaphoric basis and deceptive play of language to be able to employ it without qualifiers, disclaimers, and tedious textual self-referentiality. As is his custom, he represents his own work as a critique of others' works--Plato's &quot;Phaedo,&quot; Nietzsche's &quot;Genealogy of Morals,&quot; Kierkegaard's &quot;Fear and Trembling,&quot; and the contemporary, politically executed Polish philosopher Jan Potocka. While he establishes his distance from Plato and Nietzsche, his re-visioning of Kierkegaard offers new angles without questioning or challenging the great Dane's existential reading of the Abraham-Isaac story. And his alignment with Potocka is so complete as to suggest more an apologia than a critique of the latter's work. Add to these texts numerous references to Heidegger and to both the Old and New Testaments as well as to stories by Poe and Hawthorne, and you'll have some idea of how richly allusive, not to mention dense, Derrida's discourse can be, even in a brief work such as this.The primary requisite for reading &quot;The Gift of Death&quot; is some knowledge of its precursor, &quot;Fear and Trembling.&quot; Like Kierkegaard, Derrida defines religion as access to the responsibility of a free self, which in turn is defined as a relationship consciously and secretly experienced by the individual subject who sees him or herself in the gaze of God. Truth is separated from Socrates' truth by its interiority, by its replacement of reason, ethics, and aesthetics with the sheer horror of the abyss. Compared to Kierkegaard, however, Derrida's account is less romantic, less inspiring, more disturbing. The leap of faith involves not a sacrifice of Isaac but of oneself, a secret and senseless meeting with one's own death. Derrida interprets the absence of woman in the Abraham and Bartleby stories as proof that the &quot;knight of faith's&quot; quest is not the &quot;tragic hero's&quot;. Instead, it is beyond all knowledge, a confrontation with the abyss that marks the Absolute singularity of the self. (This latter observation is reminiscent of Marlowe's inability, or unwillingness, in Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness,&quot; to share the &quot;truth&quot; of Kurtz' final words, &quot;The horror, the horror,&quot; with Kurtz' fiance.)In the latter part of his critique, Derrida offers a paradoxical criticism of the technological, modern age. Far from becoming quantified or de-naturalized, we have returned to the demonic and orgiastic from which religion arose. Modern man has fallen into inauthenticity, becoming not a self or person but assuming the mask of a &quot;role.&quot; Present-day democracy, in turn, is not about the equality of individuals but of roles. Hence the importance of discovering and accepting the gift of death that determines human uniqueness. Responsibility is the criterion; freedom is the result.This is a work not to be read quickly or only once. Derrida moves slowly, taking two steps backward before moving one step forward, but his method insures the communication of his meanings. If it's any inducement to the reader, I would suggest that the fourth and final chapter, &quot;Tout autre est tout autre,&quot; is anticlimactic and unhelpful. By then the attentive reader will already have located the gift."

Without knowledge of Heidegger, Levinas and Kierkegaard, it is unlikely to make an impression, but the central figure of the text is Jan Patocka, a little-known Czech philosopher who is only now beginning to come to light. Contact with his thoughts on Europe and the care of the soul makes this slim tract come to life. I actually found it to be one of the clearest of Derrida's works, certainly no more challenging than the average in current continental philosophy. Illuminates the tension between secrecy and givenness, human freedom and responsibility, and shows the ways in which death opens the space for human existence. A valuable contribution to the phenomenology of religion, and destined to be one of Derrida's more widely read essays, even if it never surpasses the importance of his earlier works."

Especially the core of Derrida's analysis, how to interpret -- or to deconstruct, depending your own stance -- the story of Binding of Isaac, is insightful. One could also use it as a masterful, more or less isolated close-reading of an enigmatic story.I also liked the general idea that morality is always based on shortcomings and that the monotheistic religions try to evade this impossibility of total ethicalness by totally merging the ultimate other (the God, the permanently unknowable) within the very core of the self.The Gift of Death is short book and not easy to read. I read it as a critique of monotheism, of 'monomanic' ethics that are based on surrendering yourself to an absolute and thus to monotony, monomania, monology and singularity (as opposite to generality). If this indeed what Derrida is saying, it is not as original as the idea of deconstructing religion seem to promise. But, as always -- with Derrida it is not so much what he says, but HOW he says it. Unlike Heidegger, for instance, this is also FUN to read.A good dose of poetry makes any give subversive morality more interesting. In the words of Bob Dylan, ""Don't follow leaders, watch the parking meters."" I do both and it seems that in introducing multiple levels of simultaneous, symbolic exchange paradigms Derrida does, too."

However, this usefulness is severely limited. Deconstruction can present no positive conclusions. All it can do is show the fallibility of any attempt at such certain knowledge, primarily by exposing the inadequacy of language, a faculty so intimately connected with understanding. As a skeptic, I personally find deconstuction to be very pleasing. However, I am constantly annoyed by Derrida's insistance on frequently ignoring this aspect of his process. As a philosopher, I suppose the inclination to make some sort of positive assertion could be irresitible. I love the ""play"" and the analysis, but the attempt at ethical conclusions leaves me cold.In ""The Gift of Death,"" Derrida uses the story of Abraham and Isaac to distinguish between an absolute responsibility to ""the other"" from the typical ethical, ""known"" responsibility. I have never understood why it is that philosophers use this parable and others to decipher ethical realities. How much truth can one expect to extract from a fictional story? However, the idea that originary responsibility is always irresponsible is intriguing. Derrida proposes that Abraham's responsibility to God, the other, takes precedence over his lesser responsibilty to his son. And yet, later he makes the assertion that every other is an absolute other, making all responsibility absolute.All of this emphasis on otherness ultimately leads to a kind of ethical paralysis, but Derrida does not acknowledge this. Throughout history, small differences have been blown up into impenetrable divisions. Racism, homophobia, sexism, ethnicity, nationality, religion, all the institutions that Deconstruction usually attacks are fully supported by these ""irresponsible"" ethical conclusions.As I said before, the analysis reads like poetry and there are some very interesting ideas here. Derrida is frustrating, but worthwhile. I recommend this as well as ""Writing and Difference."""

Charles Steiner,2/5,3.0,1226016000,Old Testament Abraham and the Secret,"This is a deeply religious work, not a philosophical one, though Derrida tries to employ philosophers to help him think through the matters he wishes to write about: Carl Schmidt, Heidegger, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Levinas, Patocka.It is also an obsessive work, focused entirely on the monstrous attempt by the Old Testament Abraham to kill his biological son Isaac because of a secret bond with (a self-made) God -- and the justifications necessary to elevate this primitive and mad story to the numinous (have ""celestial capital"") and beyond morality or ethics.It is a completely bogus and irrational notion that because man cannot know ""infinite goodness"" (whatever that is), due to the fact that he is mortal and can receive ""the gift of death"" (a highly ambiguous concept even within a religious context), man has ""original sin"" (which has been so variously defined over time as to mean everything and nothing). (Derrida never defines the term.) But this idea is (nonetheless) foundational to the case Derrida wants to build about man's relationship to God (who is ""infinite goodness,"" according to Derrida) and vice-versa.It's very clear that this work (which is not clear) could not have been written without the total denial of the validity of the Law of Non-Contradiction and the Law of Identity, basic axioms of Aristotelian logic. Derrida employs these axioms, however, in his text in order to deal his readers the few creative notions he can offer (mostly puns and unusual rhetorical devices: appealing nonsense) while denying their metaphysical reality. He does make you feel something with his prissy rhetoric but he certainly cannot make you think -- unless confusion is considered a positive and valued mental state.I think the only people for whom this book can be useful or worthwhile reading are those already convinced of the value of its contents even before opening the book, that is Believers of one sort or another, including so-called agnostics. Or maybe intellectual flaneurs with nothing better to do. On the positive side, this work struck me as a complete theft of the ideas from Rudolph Otto's 1923 excellent work, ""The Idea of the Holy."" You should read that if you want a clear exposition of mysterium tremendem and mysticism. Derrida can only provide a muddy copy.Last point: In an interview Derrida gave while he was dying, Derrida said he thought Kierkegaard had too much Christianized the story of Abrahnam and Isaac, and so he wrote this particular work to correct that tendency. Well, he failed -- miserably. Not even a Reformed or Progressive Jew would agree with Derrida's views of ""no substitution"" in the matter of death, and I could infer no other idea than that Derrida was an ardent, mystical Christian in the manner of Rudolph Otto or St. Ignatius when reading this text."

He is with the pure ineffable which choses to speak to and through the failable.The very mention of such belies most of Derrida's work.The certainty that springs from his work's invalidation gives me peace that the seeker has at last found, that Jacques Derrida is now fully and forever constructed.His work is over, but his true life--as with all the lives of those who seek and ask--has resumed an ancient, intended course.Rest in freedom and fulfillment, Mr Derrida."

When literature and music are culturally interpreted, ethics are situational, when one speaks of slavery as freedom or humanity as inhumanity, we are lost in a sea of intellectual flotsam. The personal connections to fascism - Heidegger, Paul de Man, Blanchot, Bataille - can be overlooked. The intellectual similarities can't: The supremacy of will (Nietzsche) over reason and logic (""homogenising""), an obsession with emotion and political discourse, the celebration of the group over the individual (identity politics) and the idea that truth is what the critic, dictator or prophet says it is. Deconstructionism is, needless to say, popular among folks favoring modern ""intellectual"" movements with fuzzy tenets.Here, he speaks to us eliptically (of course) as he partakes in the familiar one step forward - two steps backward approach. But if one follows Deconstructionism, why can't HIS writings be interpreted as an S&M; fantasy or a desire to be a Greek Orthodox priest in drag? How do we know what he really means since he suggests that we often write exactly opposite of what we mean?. He writes of God, death, solitude, life and sacrifice BUT in a new voice of existentialism and doubt. He employs vague, self-defined and self-referential terms which effectively shield him from serious study.Derrida, for all his rampant explicating, gets hot under the collar when his own words undergo the deconstruction challenge. Few have questioned his writings since (1) many are impossible to understand and (2) they may or may not mean what they say. What began as a new approach to literature has evolved into the language of intellectual totalitarianism. No one denies his extensive knowledge of Western literature; what galls are the bewieldering interpretations and his ironic attempt at building a new ethos based on syllogism. As another reviewer stated, take it slow, read several times, search for meaning even when there is none."

Pure action all the way. If that's all your looking for, look no further. As far as details and dialogue are concerned, there is very little to sink your teeth into, which is typical for a Higgins novel. Though short and to the point, I do enjoy his books.

What he wanted to do was entertain his readers, and that is what he does, with a bang! I enjoy relaxing with an exciting, page-turning work every so often, and Mr. Higgins' Sean Dillon series is the perfect read. Yesterday was a snowy day, the office was closed, and I started this book right after lunch. The plot kept me going throughout the day, and I finished the book before turning out the light and going to bed. I will admit that, at times, Dillon's almost flawless performance becomes a tad annoying, but he is such a cheeky rascal that I can overlook that possible failing. It's just good to sink into a book, and let the author take you where he wishes. The characters are fairly engaging, and I get interested in finding out how Dillon and friends are going to make everything right in the end.

Starting with The President's Daughter, however, it's been all down hill.It's sort of like when your favorite All-star ballplayer starts hitting below .250, and never snaps out of it.I know fiction is fiction, but anyone who has even the most basic understanding of world politics will have a tough time buying into the plot.Higgins has a history of characters whose families have dual ethnicities, as does the main antagonist in this story. But Paul Rashid's background -- half Arab, half English, and he was an SAS soldier in the Gulf War -- doesn't jive with some of the things he does in the present setting of the story. Like Rashid telling all of the Arab fringe groups to start kicking up a fuss. Arafat can't control these people, but they'll listen to some guy who fought AGAINST Arabs? Don't know about that one, Jack old boy.The book boils down to the Rashids sending one hit squad after the next to knock off Dillon and his cronies, Dillon of course foiling the attempts and wasting the hitmen, and then Dillon and Ferguson et al bumping into the Rashids the next day in a nice restaurant and chatting about it."

Wearying.,"Here's the whole three hundred pages, in a nutshell: Supercool IRA hitman Sean Dillon plays some piano (cigarette hanging from lip, Hoagy Carmichael-style), cracks wise (Irish-style) with the resident skirt, kicks a** (with style, of course), and has a Bushmills. Then he goes somewhere to eat and talk, cracks wise, kicks a**, and has a Bushmills. Subsequently, he (inexplicably) gets into an underwater speargun duel, kicks a**, and manages to find a Bushmills in some hellhole in Yemen (no clean water, but they've got Bushmills). Then he takes a break, and has a Bushmills. Then he crash lands his plane after it gets machine-gunned by baddies, wins a three-page mini-Beau Geste gunfight at a deserted desert fort, cracks wise, and--even though he has to walk a few miles to get it--has a Bushmills. I could go on, but you get the picture.Ludicrous, flat, and uninvolving, from a writer who's capable of much more (The Eagle Has Landed, The Eagle Has Flown, Storm Warning, etc.). And does J.H. own stock in Bushmills' distillery, or WHAT???? Have a bourbon and soda once in a while, for the love of god."
1625,B000NRYUHO,Edge of Danger,,A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ,"Donald Mitchell ""Jesus Loves You!""",12/15,2.0,992822400,Implausible Action That Doesn't Thrill,"The premise of this book is that someone who doesn't care if he dies is unstoppable.Mr. Higgins's invincible hero in Edge of Danger is the familiar Sean Dillon, ex-IRA, who continues his role in earlier Higgins books of foiling terrorists on behalf of the British government. The terrorists here come from a wealthy, influential British family (the Daunceys) with Bedouin roots (the Rashids) as well. The Rashids employ IRA and Arab mercenaries to execute their plans, but get their own hands pretty dirty in the process.The book is marred by several problems. First, Dillon's inevitable success makes the action seem redundant. Second, there's too much action crammed into the story (enough for about four books) so you don't get the careful build-up of tension and then relief that makes action thrilling to read about. You just get another punch in the stomach, and move on to the next. Third, this book is about meglomania on such a grand scale as to be like looking inside an insane asylum. That robs the story of validity. Fourth, the villains are cut out of such thin cardboard that all you can tell about them is that they are crazy, rich, and stupid. The threat from their plots is hard to take seriously. Fifth, the book relies on references to products and brands as the primary means to establish mood and setting, a weak method to employ in such a sketchy book.I was surprised by how far Mr. Higgins has strayed from his roots as a thoughtful thriller writer. In Edge of Danger, he has almost written a satire of his own work. In fact, the book is almost a crossover into the worst of the post-Ian Fleming 007 books.The point he wants to make is that honesty and loyalty are what count, rather than one's ancestors, money, or influence. That message seems distorted by the fact that Sean Dillon turns out to be available to run errands for the rich without fully understanding what he is facilitating. What good are honesty and loyalty if they can be suborned by almost anyone, including the creeps in this book? This early betrayal of the Dillon character by Mr. Higgins sets up a reason for Dillon to be angry and want revenge, but even that's not carried off well. Between violent episodes, the good guys and the bad guys are having civil little chats with one another suggesting that the bad guys should mend their ways.Unlike many series, you could skip this book and not miss a single important development about Sean Dillon and his colleagues. If you do decide to read Edge of Danger, set a time limit and read quickly. That will make the experience more exciting by giving you a real source of suspense. Will you finish the book before your time runs out?After you finish the book (if you insist on reading it), I suggest that you contemplate what makes thrillers thrilling. What draws you to this genre? How can you tell if a book will meet that promise from reviews? Which reviewers are reliable and which praise everything? How can you evaluate whether to finish such a book once you've started? What face do you want evil to show, in order to make the triumph of good rewarding?Seek out the spread of goodness in all that you do!"
1626,B000NRYUHO,Edge of Danger,,A27WFYW9ZJ5DN1,Newt Gingrich,9/11,4.0,985132800,Another great adventure,"Many years ago Jack Higgins wrote The Eagle Has Landed, one of the best adventure novels of my lifetime. Then he wrote Storm Warning, an extraordinarily good adventure novel. In total he has written 29 adventure books. Most have been pot-boilers (a nineteenth century term for light novels you read while waiting for the pot to boil).Higgins developed a set of characters involved in counter espionage and trying to stop bad guys from succeeding. In the post cold war world he has found an increasing range of bad guys. Edge of Danger is worth reading as a reminder of several key realities of our time. There are many people with massive resources who may decide they dislike us for reasons of their own. They may have backgrounds that give them remarkable knowledge of and contacts in our society. A free society is remarkably open and vulnerable.The details of this book are not believable but the overlying sense of vulnerability and threat are as real as the Taliban destroying priceless historic monuments and Osama bin Laden still holding press conferences eight years after the United States began trying to knock him out of the terrorist business. If you are looking for a quick read in a world of adventure and danger this will get your mind off whatever you have been worried about and remind you of the real threats the CIA and the FBI have to worry about. I look forward to Higgins' next work."

The author bumbles a chance to knock off a key character - losing the opportunity to add some tension and passion to the survivors. Incredibly, this person takes three bullets and lives. The plot is solid and fast paced. My only problem is with the enemies. They are too cold and their motives are weak. The key assaisin could audition for the Key Stone Cops. Don't get me wrong, the Edge of Danger is a good yarn. I hope Higgins continues to improve the depth and reality of his characters. I look forward to the next edition."

Paul Rashid's family's motives and characters were superficially explained and Kate is nothing but a talking mannequin. For Dillon to lose control over an assassin in his own home and allow Hannah to nearly get killed is unreal. The author brings numerous characters (i.e. Blake and Villiers) in and out without giving them much to do. I think Higgins is getting lazy and it shows in this book.

He pickup a couple of his terrorism/criminal partners making killing like a habits, terrorism competition, fun game and egoism fulfillment. It so far from any common sense such as the British General could not control this maniacal killer and let he kills who he wish to kill or threaten his masculinity.

The plot is silly. The dialogue is written to tell the reader what's going on (and every character speaks with the same voice) - this isn't how real people speak. Then the characters overexplain because, apparently, the author wasn't paying attention when he gave you the same information a dozen or so pages ago.Frankly, I've read enough about the IRA and Prods and One Para and County Down to last me the rest of my born days.

Some were great and full of suspense. But the last three he has written, including this one, &quot;Edge of Danger&quot;, are very disappointing. He has resorted to producing 2 books a year, based on the formula of a superficial story line with no depth, predictable characters, and it seems that he now writes just to capitalize on his prior reputation as a good suspense writer.Count the number of Marlboros smoked, the amount of Bushmills and champagne drank, (and in the midst he changes his champagne brand which makes one wonder whether he has received a better commission from one favorite to another), and you find a shallow book. I would save my money on this one, and buy it only if you collect Higgins First Editions, hoping to capitalize someday on the commercial side of selling all Higgins books to a collector."

I should mention that while the title of the version I listened to says that the book was abridged, the product description (as well as the cover of my set) clearly demonstrates that I did listen to the entire book, so I was not &quot;spared&quot; any of the &quot;bad&quot; parts.I stumbled upon Jack Higgins' books a couple years ago and have been hooked ever since. The Edge of Danger was no different than the rest, being very well done and hard to put down. Perhaps if I had been reading the book, I might have been disturbed by the dialog that others have complained about, but on tape, the narrative flowed smoothly. Others have complained about the plot, but I found the plot enjoyable, as Dillon and friends try to keep ahead of the Rashids, who are driven by the intense desire to revenge their mother's death and the assassination attempt against Paul Rashid. In addition, this book delved further into the personalities and natures of Dillon and the other characters than many of the other books. I appreciated seeing the reasons why Dillon is driven to perform certain actions instead of only what actions he actually takes.I like to listen to books by Jack Higgins when I am in the car, and this one, just like all the others, was a good choice. For those interested in the aspects of the audio version, Patrick McNee does an outstanding job of narrating Higgins' books, and I now look for his name if I am purchasing a new audio book. He smoothly switches among the various accents represented in Higgins' books, speaking clearly and with enjoyable, believable expression. Higgins' books seem particularly conducive for listening to, as things are written in a straightforward manner. This contrasts with this writing of Tom Clancy, to whom Higgins may be compared, because Clancy moves so rapidly from scene to scene that it is very difficult to follow. When Higgins changes scenes, I have no problem following while I am listening to the book.In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed this book so much that when I would get home from work, I would take the tapes out of the car and bring them into the house because I was so anxious to learn what was going to happen next. I certainly recommend this book for anyone looking for an enjoyable read."

Not even an exclamation mark. Many other examples could be given. Now, assuming for the moment that the dialog was, say, written at greater than a 7th grade level, the plot is almost as bad. The protagonists' reactions to their fellows getting knocked off one-by-one is almost comic. There's no depth here; just one simple vignette after another. I wouldn't even want to compare this to Ludlum or Clancy (although Clancy's gotten a bit rough of late).A terrific waste of a good"

1652,B000NRYUHO,Edge of Danger,,A1F38YS15PWMRQ,"RachelWalker ""RachelW""",1/3,5.0,1007164800,Brilliant plot driven novel,"Jack Higgins a.k.a Granny's favourite.His world war 2 novels were very well written, with good plots. However, these latest Higgins novels lack something which the early Higgins novels had in abdance. They were obviously written by a person with a high command of the English language.His latest books have been somewhat lacluster in the way they are written. He seems to have cast aside the need to write well in favour of high powered plots.Lucky for him it works. Many authors couldn't get away with letting their writing get slack. But with Higgins, we just don't seem to care. And Why? Because his plots are so damn good. He writes to a very old formula of action novels. There is a flawed but brilliant hero, and a girl, and a formidable enemy. throw in different world location, lots of guns, lots of fighting, and simmer for 15 minutes. It is a very simple formua, and one which he never strays from. SOme people criticise him because they believe this shows a lack of depth and range. In some ways they are right, but in others wrong. It is really great hwo he can just put pen to paper, no matter what he writes, and just make you want to turn the page. Also, it astounds me how he manages to come up with so many differney and exciting ideas which still manage to satisfy his writing formula. it is simple yet effective.This latest book is no less a pageturner than several of his previous ones. He has a great plot here, and a great, and very popular lead character, and one of the best baddies in a long time.extract from blurb: &quot;When Paul Rashid, leader of the Rashid Bedouin of Hazar in the Persian Gulf, uncovers an international conspiracy to deprive his family of the oil wealth that is theirs by right, he vows to gain vengeance. The man sent to stop him is the British Government's uncompromising sevret enforcer Sean Dillon. It is a mission that will test him as never before, confronted by old foes and new in a deadly game of cat and mouse that will take him from Ireland to the USA, and from the heart of the English countryside to the deserts of the Hazar...and the very edge of danger.&quot;This in itself promises a brilliant an exciting book. Especially with such motives of the villain, who the reader empathises with right from the very beginning, hoping against hope that he does in fact gain his vengeance. It's a strange device Higgins uses here, because the reader knows they are not supposed to want the villain to win. But in this book you just can't help it. You feel so much sympathy with the fact with the fact taht Russia and America are trying to take away their families land and oil. You will him on, to win. And you, for once, wish Sean Dillion would fail. It's a book that really toys with your emotions.Because the characters are so compelling, and the plot so great, it more than covers up for the fact that they are not actually very much more than card-board cut outs. He doesn't draw his characters in any depth, but you.just.dont.care.I got through this book in a single day. It's excellent. It starts with a bang (when a gypsy insults Paul rashid's mother and abuses, whereupon Paul goes to the gypsy camp to have it out with the man, and ends up cutting his ear off). and does not let up from there.Higgins writes excellent plot-driven thrillers. As well as being able to be very tender with his writing. There are times when you want to cry (rather like with his previous book &quot;The President's Daughter&quot;).Another good thing about this book is Paul Rashid's sister, Lady Kate Rashid. She's superb. A wonderfully strong willed young woman, who vows vengeance upon Sean Dillion right at the end of the book. I cannot wait for the sequel. Kate Rashid pitted against Dillion, will be an absolutely wonderful read.This book comes highly reccomended, with a stunning plot and compelling characters. You shoudl definitely give it a try if you like quick, exciting reads. But if you think that half the beauty of a book is in the writing, then it probably isn't for you.great. can't wait for Midnight Runner"

Bukowsky ""booklover10""",3/3,2.0,1001808000,Sean Dillon opposes a ruthless family bent on revenge.,"The villains in &quot;Edge of Danger&quot; are the Rashids, a ridiculously wealthy family that is half-Arab and half-English. The leader of the clan is Paul Rashid, who is a graduate of the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst and is also a decorated veteran of the Gulf War. Paul's two brothers, Michael and George, are also graduates of Sandhurst, and their beautiful sister, Kate, attended Oxford University.Paul Rashid is enraged when his mother is killed by a Russian commercial attache driving on the wrong side of the road. It turns out that the Russian, whose name is Gatov, enjoys diplomatic immunity; he is brokering an oil deal in the Middle East for the Russians and the Americans. The interests of Gatov and his friends conflict with the oil interests of the Rashid family. Paul Rashid decides that it is in his best interests to strike at his enemies before they can strike at him. He forms a plot to assassinate the President of the United States.&quot;Edge of Danger&quot; is basically a cat and mouse game between Paul and his family on one side, and Sean Dillon, the former IRA soldier and scourge of the British military, on the other side. Sean occasionally does dirty work for his former enemy, Brigadier General Charles Ferguson. When Ferguson needs a tough job done on behalf of the British government, he calls in Dillon, who is an expert marksman, knows how to fly any plane that exists, and can even scuba dive.Dillon and his cohorts fight it out with Rashid and his hired thugs, and a great deal of blood is spilled. In this violent book, people die in many ways, such as knifing, gunshot wounds, having their necks broken, drowning, and falling off balconies. Rashid is little more than a rich sociopath, and his character makes little sense. Why would a man who enjoys enormous wealth and an enviable social position behave like a common thug? His excuse that he wants &quot;vengeance&quot; doesn't explain his completely irrational behavior.Although the action scenes are exciting enough, carnage alone is not enough to make a book credible and interesting. None of the characters rises above the level of a stereotype. &quot;Edge of Danger&quot; is basically a string of bloody action scenes glued together with some exposition and stilted dialogue. I do not recommend it."

Regrettably that time was the mid 1980's. I have increasingly become disenchanted with his storylines and two dimensional characters. It is perhaps time for Mr. Sean Dillon to retire from active service.As other reviewers have said, there is very little (if any) true plot to &quot;Edge of Danger&quot;. The entire Rashid family are thin and vacuous. Paul's motives most especially are questionable. This novel is a complete parody of Jack's earlier (and more entertaining) works.A common thread of recent Jack Higgins novels has been the very formulaic writing style...for example... a cheesy villain arrives on the scene and does something to upset Ferguson and Dillon. Dillon takes on the job of figuring out the villain's plan. Ferguson berates Dillon for his cavalier attitude. Dillon has a Bushmill's. Villain and Dillon talk and talk and talk. Dillon somehow manages to save the day. All along the way re-reminding readers of Dillon's past with the IRA. You'd think after all this time Mr. Higgins would have assumed his fans know this fact.Save your money on this one. I'd love to be able to recommend it, but simply cannot. It's a tiresome and insubstantial read."

1660,B000NRYUHO,Edge of Danger,,A3PQQERLSN0MQG,Edmund Khoo,2/2,2.0,1086566400,Safety a priority,"Unlike most other books written by Jack Higgins, &quot;Edge of Danger&quot; suffers from several major problems. Rather than careful plotting and suspense, the narrative descends spectacularly into a series of uneven gunfights. While this makes for some reasonable- if shallow reading, the plot is further marred by the unerring success rate of the protagonist Sean Dillon (in one of many appearances) and his nigh-on invulnerability.The premise is simple: A nefarious, rich family with both Engliah and Arab heritage hatches a plot to overturn the world order while lining their pockets. As expected, ex-IRA Sean Dillion is pitted against the undertakings and is characteristically successful in thwarting their plans.While at times interesting, &quot;Edge of Danger&quot; is an uneven read, punctuated with frequent doses of shallow action and insufficient character development/description. What is initially an interesting premise is marred by the invincibility of Sean Dillion and the lack of any concrete narrative structure. &quot;The Eagle has Landed&quot; remains Jack Higgins's finest offering"
1661,B000NRYUHO,Edge of Danger,,A1AV32Q6I8M1LX,"snowy ""Lorne Vallen""",2/2,1.0,1027900800,A [sad] product of a master,"This novel has got more plot holes than a mosquito net and more repetitions than financial scandals in corporate America. Did Jack Higgins think he was designing a computer game with progressive scenarios and cut scenes of tete-a-tete between the heroes and the villains between scenarios?The premise of the story was this: a union of the a Mid-Eastern tribe and a Scottish noble family produced the Rashid-Daunceys, financially rich, ambitious and aristocratic from long traditions. Family motto ""I Always Return"".All the male scions of the family graduated Stanhurst, with the eldest, Paul, serving in the Gulf War and Northern Ireland. Post Gulf War, they concentrated their efforts to monopolise control of the oil production in their native Bedu. Enter American-Russian consortium intent on bypassing the Rashids, involving some failed assassination attempt on Paul. An unfortunate accident also killed their mother, coincidentally involving a Russian representative of the consortium.It was from here that the plot began to become ridiculous. Granted that their Arabic blood (and Scottish as well) demanded some revenge, but Paul chose the assassination of the US president to make a warning against messing with the Bedu, never mind that the president Jake Cavalet was acknowledged as a decent guy who was not involved.The first big question was: even if they could assassinate Jake Cavalet, how would the world know it was for messing with the Bedu? And if the Bedu or the Rashids claimed the kill, what would be left of the Bedu or the Rashids after the outraged Americans were done with their vengeance? Frederick Forsyth's Day of the Jackal had the assassin carefully planning his moves, erasing his tracks and maintaining his anonymity, intending on permanent retirement in the aftermath. In contrast, Higgins' plotters talked like they accepted such deals every second Tuesday of the month.The failed attempt of Jake Cavalet (no thanks to dismal security), and capture of one of the assassins, leaked the entire plot to the president, his advisor Blake Johnson, and through a connection with Sean Dillon, the British PM and MG Ferguson of Group 4. This was where the ridiculousness was brought to a new height - they did nothing except to watch the Rashids and try to catch the Rashids at the next attempt. Had there been no surviving witnesses, the authorities might not have been able to do anything. But enough evidence was present to confirm the Rashids involvement, and instead of bringing the very expensive agencies, the US and UK leaders took the passive role. The Rashids swaggered through town with impunity after failing to kill the US president and left one of the assassins to be captured alive; this was where the book lost its credibility altogether.The rest of the book had Sean Dillon playing cat-and-mouse game with the Rashids, except that they could not agree who was to be mouse and who was to be the cat.Jack Higgins tried to make this a little different from his previous Dillon-is-the-hero book by introducing two sidekicks for him; former London gangsters; one of whom the readers were repeatedly reminded of how many times he was imprisoned, and Jack also took out policewoman Hannah Bernstein, having her wounded and confined to the hospital. However, instead of making this book fresh or different, the scenes became trite with cliche conversations and reactions from the characters.Though the locations moved across the world from UK to US to the Bedu's Hazar in the Middle East, there was nothing meaningful significance about each scene. In the end, it concluded with Paul Rashid telling his sister Kate that he wanted to continue the game with Dillon because it gave him more kick than earning another billion. The charaters in this book could hardly be less cardboard-like.The epilogue ended with Kate Rashid, still a free (and bloody rich) woman, despite being clearly and personally involved in the plots, promising vengeance on Ferguson, Dillon & Co., all in a cozy bar just like the British commenting on the weather. The hint of the sequel did not hold much promise, Jack Higgins had better realise how awful this book was before he became condemned permanently as a has-been. He ought to re-study his previous books like Cold Harbour, the Eagle had landed and A Game for Heroes to rediscover the human element which made his book so good."

If it were, it would also be my last.Normally, I can forgive Higgins his cliche's and his obsessive attention to his characters' drinking habits, because his characters are fun and interesting. He puts them in great plots and pulls the reader happily through them, and you can't wait to find the next book especially if it's got Sean Dillon.But not this one. All the characters are wooden. The action is colorless and completely unbelievable. A president guarded only by one secret service agent and a dog? A professional assassin who whacks his target on the head and then shoots someone else?There is no sense of timing or place, only the thinnest of motivations for most characters, and no justification for many of the decisions made by characters.This book is amateur hour. Don't bother. Read some of Higgins's earlier works instead."

That said, it wasn't the worst book I have read, but it certainly is the worst I have read recently. Since this is my first go at reading Higgins I will assume perhaps he is an acquired taste that I just haven't acquired as of yet.My suspension of disbelief was stretched to the limit and beyond by such gems as (***** Spoilers follow *****)* The president of the United States only has 2 secret service men every weekend, and one of those is a communications guy.* A billionaire hires an assassin apparently incapable of accomplishing the simplest of tasks. Why didn't he use a law rocket instead of a sniper rifle? Don't you think a billionaire could hire several competent assassins?* Why could Dillon just go round and shoot the bad guys sometimes but other times he needed proof.* Continually the bad guy keeps trying to kill Dillon at every opportunity ""because he is not expecting it right now"". Well golly gee, I guess maybe Dillon would never have caught on to that the first dozen or so times Rashid tried to have him offed.I sort of liked Sean Dillon but at times the novel seemed almost a self-parody. The number of times the characters threatened to do one another in face to face was ludicrous. Really, why not just pull out the guns and have at it right there.Now I am going to go drink a Bushmills. The worst part is I might actually buy the follow-up book to this one because I developed a modicum of curiosity as to the future these characters. So it wasn't a total loss.

They hire a completely inept assassin to take down the President of the USA, or, when that doesn't work, an Arab Council of Elders, or, when that doesn't work, the Russian Premier (and that doesn't work). Yes, it's ridiculous.Sean is the same caricature of himself, with a growing disciple in young Billy Slater, who should be killed off ASAP. Blake is the same, only useless in this story. Hannah is the same, only even flatter as a character. The Brigadier is still a dullard. The Rashids are supposedly bad, bad guys and gal. Bored yet? If the story doesn't hold you, you could always entertain yourself by counting references to Bushmill's whiskey. You'd have to pay me a lot to go back through this book but I bet there are hundreds.I pick up Jack Higgins's books sometimes because they're usually good entertainment, despite being cliched, generally preposterous, and awfully short on character development. This one, though, was so bad it can't be forgiven. My advice is to skip it.And if that wasn't enough: Patrick Mcnee's narration on the audiotape version was awful.

You've been damaged enough. He wanted to keep you out of it. You see, a face-to-face confrontation with Rashid will probably be like a spaghetti western.'""Unfortunately, a spaghetti western would have more character development and plot than this work. As in his last several novels, this one seems to read more like a Greek tragedy with limited character development and style. His formulaic style continues where the good guys do evil (at times) for the right cause and the bad guys are misguided and do evil for the wrong cause.In this case, the Earl of Loch Dhu, Paul Rashid, leads the evil empire. Paul is of mixed blood involving the aristocracy in England and in the province of Hazar, in the Persian Gulf. ""The two traditions flowed together in their blood, the medieval British and the Bedouin, producing a general fierceness that was remarked upon in Paul, . . ."" In short, a powerful man that when crossed or defied can seek powerful vengeance.And vengeance is the theme and motivator for all character actions in this simply plotted novel. Rashid and his two brothers and one sister, control a large empire of holdings in a variety of interests. The sultan of Hazar, bypasses their interests, to make an oil deal with the Americans and the Russians. If that wasn't enough, the ungrateful Sultan, is also apparently part of a plot to assassinate the Rashids. The plot is easily foiled with the assassins slain in the desert.Of course, such an act demands vengeance on a local level as well as at the ultimate levels in the American and Russian governments. The people that lead these two nations must die so the world will know of their actions and resulting punishment. Enter General Ferguson, Sean Dillon and the usual suspects of the British Intelligence Service who plan to stop the attacks, one way or another.This novel continues in the recent tradition of Jack Higgins. The writing is weak, the character development is exceedingly limited, the style is poor and the scenic descriptions are poor. The sameness of his recent novels continues and the reader is left with the sense that this has been read before, many times. It is unfortunate that he continues in the slide from the promise of his early novels to a writing style and effort that just seems to be going through the motions for a few sales. This author has talent and expertise that he simply is not using, for whatever reason, and that is a shame."

I have enjoyed his books before, and admired his plots. In this book, the plot has potential, although is presented in a thin and stereotyped way. But the story and its telling let the plot down. The plot never gets developed in a believable way, or even at all. The dialogue is mostly obvious, inane, and unimaginative. The characters are cardboard replicas of what they could have been. I get the impression that a book, riding on the superb reputation of the author, was slapped together in the hopes of eliciting a lucrative movie rights deal. Since the story gets substantially rewritten when made into a movie, why bother with creating interesting characters or putting much effort into the book itself? The money is in the movie.I also find the story somewhat insulting. The Russians and the Americans (oil companies) have conspired together to drill oil wells all over the desert. Some political correctness here, Greens and Friends of the Earth to the rescue! Everyone sits calmly by while the locals (some sort of Arab tribe) skin alive some poor throw-away British Army junior officer. But the hardened heros take it all in stride. Business as usual for the tough guys. Plastic scene. And, there are others.The final scene, the climax of the plot, is a total flop, written it seems, out of boredom with the story, just to get it over.I am left with the nagging question: did Jack Higgins really write this terrible book himself, or did he hire someone to do it for him? At least with Mozart's Requiem we are left with a great piece of music and a mystery about who wrote it. In this case, we only have the mystery."

As a kid I read every Ian Fleming 007 book I could find. Granted Higgins is not Fleming and Sean Dillon is not James Bond-but I draw the parallel just the same because I like the action stories and Jack Higgins never disappoints when it comes to action. If you like the action/danger story, one that will most assuredly place you at the edge of your chair, at the edge of your bed, or at the edge of your toilet seat, depending on where you do your most serious reading, then Edge of Danger is the book for you. Jack Higgins is a far better writer than I so when I offer criticism I do it in my most humble way. So here it is, I get tired of plots involving the President of the United States."

As I travelled thro' the pages it just got harder and harder to believe the simplicity with which Mr Dillon strolls thro' the events at hand. The story also lacks any imagination and could probably have been summed up in a short story.

1685,B000NRYUHO,Edge of Danger,,,,4/5,1.0,998179200,By far Higgins' worst yet,"I buy all of Jack Higgins' books. For a thriller/espionage writer, his books have a QWON about them, they are well written, engaging, don't bog down into technical details, and offer a very entertaining story. There is so much (crud) in this genre, that Higgins' usually proves a ray of sunshine. Most of his books I have read multiple times.Edge of Danger is decidedly so unlike Higgins' previous literary titles, that I would be inclined to believe someone else wrote it (with exception to a few decent chapters). I think the character Dillon needs to be retired, which is alluded to in the last few chapters. This series in Higgins' catalogue is becoming boilerplate pulp. I think the Dillon series really began taking a turn for the worse several books back, although there was hope offered in Drink With the Devil. I most certainly hope we can expect other works from Higgins' along the line of Flight of Eagles, because this series is merely becoming silly. I certainly hope he does not trade Dillon for Salter and continue the series somehow!"

The way the book begins, you think that the Rashid's are the good guys, and Dillin is the bad guy. Then all the sudden, without developing the characters, the roles are switched. You end up not caring who dies (and 6 billion people die in this book...a little overkill) and who lives.The ""adventures"" are similar to Dora the Explorer in how boring they are. They are very predictable, and of course, Dillin is killing 50 people and no one can kill him. Just ridiculous scenes.Don't get this book, despite the ""reliablity"" of the author."

It is not great literature, but provides some light brain candy. Lots of bodies are left lying around as people are killed by various means (shooting, drowning, incineration, torture, falling off a roof).An Arab fanatic, annoyed by U.S. and Russian oil interests exploiting his country, decides on a high profile assassination. Nothing seems to work out for the bad guys, but some of the British ended up wounded.The story has an interesting ending with a very rich woman with a grudge, biding her time, and planning to spend portions of her wealth to get revenge. It brings to mind Matilda of Flanders (wife of King William I) who, spurned by a Saxon nobleman when she was a teenager, waited 20 years until William conquered England, then tracked down the Saxon and had him thrown into a dungeon."

Kindler,1/2,1.0,1067472000,Not worth the effort,"Edge of Danger is yet another installment of the on-going saga of Dillon, Ferguson and Bernstein. If you truly enjoyed the preceding efforts by Higgins, then you might like Edge of Danger (because it is more of the same). However, if you have been growing disenchanted by Higgins' efforts, then you probably want to take a pass on this (and for me at least, future efforts as well). Higgins' books are more and more like screen plays and less and less like novels. Dialog between the characters, which often is terse, choppy, and unimaginative, makes up virtually all of the text. Higgins almost completely avoids the opportunity add any depth and breadth to the story through the use of descriptive text. As with the last few books from Higgins, Edge of Danger is clearly a disappointment."

And sure you have to suspend disbelief occassionally to make the plot work - but what's the harm with that? I enjoyed this book. It returns Higgins back to form after a number of less successful books in recent years. Even inspite of the cliches and plot formulas, there is a distinct 'grittiness' about the characters, which has been long over due."

Also, the plants he chooses to list seem to have come off the shelf of some musty old occult shop and not out of the author's garden. How can you claim to know anything about the plant and its powers if you know it only in death and have never experienced it alive and growing.Also, I sadly discovered that the author's scholarship is actually somewhat lacking. He describes Milkweed as the plant which attracts Monarch Butterflies, which is correct, unfortunately he lists the plant with the scientific name &quot;Apocynum Androsaemifolium&quot; which, while also sometimes called milkweed, has nothing to do with monarch butterflies. This plant is also sometimes called Dogbane and its a shrub which is totally unrelated to plants in the Asclepiadaceae family, which monarchs frequent. He lists the correct milkweed under its genus name, Asclepias, and never mentions monarchs.Since I discovered this error it has called into question all of the information in the book and I hesitate to use it as a reference in my magical practice."

Unfortunately, it is also the part needing the most work. For example, Beyerl tells us that the energetics of a solar herb is hot and drying, and that a lunar herb is cool and moistening. This is actually very helpful information. However, he lists ginger as a lunar herb!! The logic of this absurdity defies comprehension! Ginger is one of the hottest and most drying herbs we have! Clearly it should be a solar herb! This most obvious contradiction calls into question Beyerl's other correspondence listings.If astrological herbalism is to be taken seriously -- and there is no reason why it cannot be, assuming it accurately portrays the energetics of herbs -- it must become more rigorous, adopt accurate criteria for classification, and come up with a comprehensive and noncontradictory system that is also useful in clinical practice. Peter Holmes' book The Energetics of Western Herbs would be a useful place to begin, as he accurately describes the advantages and disadvantages of the Galenic system that astrological herbalism builds upon. Rather than attempting to interpret the planetary attributes of an herb according to its analytic effect upon isolated tissues, it would be better for astrology to develop a bodily energetics based upon the planetary archetypes. In this way, the energetics of a planet would nicely fit both physiological conditions and herbal properties, rather than trying to fit an energetic model into an anatomic model which it poorly fits. Planetary attributes of herbs must be distinguished in terms of various categories : medical/therapeutic, archetypal/active, etc. For example, certain plants have become associated with the activities of certain planets / gods which makes sense mythically, but not necessarily clinically in a medical or therapeutic sense. This does not invalidate either, but requires specific elucidation in an herbal, so we may distinguish amongst categories.We need to be fair. Beyerl has done a great deal of synthesis in his book, especially on the magical properties of herbs, which does not particularly interest me. And he cannot be blamed for the rather pathetic state of modern astrological herbalism, which is in great need of intelligent, synthetic, and clinical revival. However, without dialogue with the author -- which I would welcome, by the way -- I cannot understand his method of planetary alignment with many of these herbs.I will say that pages 434 - 453 (&quot;Working With Astrological Correspondences&quot;) is one of the strongest parts of the book, which gives us an awesome and fairly comprehensive nature of the energetics of the planets. It is only when we come to the listings that I begin to question."

Few novels inspire as much contemplation and feeling on the part of the reader. Hester Prynne, American fiction's first and foremost female heroine continues to haunt this world, inspiring a never-ending stream of scholarly debate. Even in our less puritanical age, some doubtless see her as a villainously great temptress, but to me she is a remarkably brave hero indeed. Her sin is known to all, and she never runs away from it, bearing the scarlet letter on her bosom bravely for all to see; she realizes the true measure of that sin, fretting constantly over the effects it will have on young Pearl, remaining steadfast in her beliefs while at the same time envisioning a new society where women and men can exist on more equal terms, free of the stultifyingly harsh punishments meted out on even the most repentant of souls by Puritanism. She shows her noble spirit by refusing to name her partner in sin and goes so far as to allow the ruthless Roger Chillingworth to torment the man she loves deeply enough to protect him for all time. Little Pearl is somewhat of an enigma, truly manifesting traits of both the imp and the little angel; her questions about the letter her mother wears and the minister who continually holds his hand against his heart reflect an insight that amazes this reader. Chillingworth is a thoroughly black-hearted man; I can certainly understand the blow he sustained as a result of Hester's sin, but his actions and thirst for prolonged revenge on the so-called perpetrator of the wrong he suffered can only be described as roguish and unpalatable.Of course, the most complex character in the novel (and literature as a whole) is the good minister Arthur Dimmsdale. One is compelled to both like him and despise him. He is basically a good man and an unquestionably fine soldier in the army of the Lord, winning many souls to God with his impassioned sermons. He is more aware than anyone else of his sinful nature, and he punishes himself quite brutally in private in a useless attempt to make up for the public ignominy he lacks the moral courage to call upon himself with a public profession of his deed. Dimmsdale is a coward and a hypocrite. At one critical moment in the latter pages of the novel, he blames Hester for his state of misery, and it is that comment in particular that makes this tragic character a man I can only commiserate with to a limited degree. Even at the penultimate moment of the novel, as he finally bears the mark of his shame and guilt for all his parishioners to see, the very men and women who have viewed him as a saintly man of God rather than the brigand he knows himself to be, he does not openly confess-his words and deeds do make plain the secret of his heart, but it is his lack of a thoroughly bold confession that causes some of his most devoted followers, so Hawthorne tells us, to blindly judge his final act as an illustrative parable on the danger of sin threatening each member of his congregation rather than an admission of guilt and self-condemnation."

1738,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,A3IVWEZ3YO7GQ0,Lucy Yu,1/2,3.0,1174953600,"a little give, little take","Upon finishing The Scarlet Letter, I would have to say that I was met with mixed emotions. While I enjoyed the storyline and reading about the characters, the length of the novel irked me a little, particularly because Hawthorne tend to overelaborate certain minor aspects of the story that are rather trivial and frivolous to the overall plot.I really enjoyed the content of the book as a whole. Hester's experience of being socially isolated due to her having a child, Pearl, with someone other than her husband evoked a kind of sympathy matched with curiosity in me. Early on in the novel, I felt disgusted at the townspeople for treating her this way, but soon discovered that Hester's wearing of her sin and the story behind it made for a rather interesting drama. Hawthorne definitely knows how to keep the reader interested, because this book contains everything we like to see in good literature: scandal, romance, an illegitimate child, irony, and the good old allusions.However, as good as this novel might seem to be, everyone should beware that this book is excessively long and at times extremely boring. While you argue that ""boring"" contradicts the previous paragraph, let me justify myself in saying that while the storyline itself is brilliant, Hawthorne's writing style of being overly descriptive and sentimental ticked me off a little. Something that is written in 50 pages can easily be cut to ten, since those 50 pages are mostly fluff and fillers anyway.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves good literature, and also has the patience and dicipline to stick to it."
1739,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,A1YB29BIDULEYE,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""",1/2,5.0,1154908800,Intense and Fierce.,"Hawthorne's ""Fanshawe"" was respectable and well done. But in his ""The Scarlet Letter,"" Hawthorne takes his writing to darker and more intense levels. The story starts with Hester Prynne being mocked and scoffed at in public for her crime of adultery. Her affair has resulted in an illegitimate daughter Pearl. And her penalty of death is reduced to wearing an A. Interestingly, if we read ""Dante's Inferno,"" we know that adultery is virtually the LEAST punished sin in hell. Apparently none of the authorities read this. (""Dante's Inferno"" was written about 400 years before the events of ""The Scarlet Letter,"" so the authorities could have been familiar with it.) Moving on, Reverend Dimmesdale (Pearl's unknown father) can not bring himself to confess, but he does clearly tell Hester she can name him if she chooses. She declines. It is interesting that Hawthorne keeps Pearl somewhat disturbed. (At one point, she rips flowers, throws them at Hester's A, and dances every time she hits it. Another time she throws rocks at birds.) In comes Roger. (Step aside Othello. You've been outsmarted, outstyled, and outclassed.) Hester is of course frightened that her husband Roger has found out about her affair. But Roger makes it clear that physical vengeance is beneath him. Interestingly, Roger wants revenge for himself, but to some extent he blames himself for what happened. Naturally, Roger wants to find out who Pearl's father is, but Hester declines. Though Roger makes it clear that Pearl's father has wronged both Roger and Hester. (Can we really deny this?) Roger is by far the most intelligent and captivating character in the story. Rather than wanting revenge for himself, he seems to want revenge for both himself AND Hester. It doesn't take the sharp Roger long to suspect that the now growing ill Dimmesdale is the father of Pearl. ButRoger is no Othello. He studies the situation as carefully as possible. And when he is certain, this is when his revenge kicks in. Dimmesdale despite his crime is still a human being. His remorse is great, and even when he tries to hint at how bad he is, his anxiety only increases. Why? THE PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH LOVE HIM ALL THE MORE FOR IT! He becomes even more of a hero for it. (Why not? Fake heroes think they're above everyone. A true hero admits he has faults. Modesty actually becomes a hero more.) And, this is where Roger's revenge kicks in. Dimmesdale is growing more ill, and Roger (no simpleton like Othello) actually uses his medical skills to keep Dimmesdale alive. Roger is smart enough to know that keeping Dimmesdale alive is hurting him more than any physical revenge could have. One fault Hester has is that she doesn't warn Dimmesdale about Roger. To be sure, she promised Roger she wouldn't reveal him as her husband, but she could have (without breaking her promise) warned Dimmesdale to avoid the dangerous Roger. It is interesting that in this story, there are no real heroes. Hester is too much of a back stage player; Pearl is too disturbed; Dimmesdale helps Hester keep Pearl from the authorities who want to take her away, but at best he arguably triumphs in the midst of his fault; and even my favorite character Roger becomes too evil to be classified as the hero. It would seem even non physical revenge can leave one psychologically warped. Moving on, Hester and Dimmesdale feel that escaping to Europe is their only chance to escape Roger. But Roger (unlike Othello) is not so easily duped or defeated. The end explodes into a dark and frightening climax. Hawthorne cleverly avoids a happy cliche romance ending, but at the same time frees Dimmesdale from Roger's evergrowing hate and fury. Roger sounds almost demonic when he says: ""Thou hast escaped me."" But Hawthorne reminds us that Roger was a human being. He interestingly leaves his wealth to Pearl. Overall, Hawthorne did a great job of showing his fierce edge in this book. We have rich complex characters who do NOT fall into typical patterns. He also reminds us that people are not all good or evil. They have some of each. Overall, Hawthorne's writing here is arguably very close to Charles Dickens."
1740,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,A2WNYQ4FH71F07,Iris Lim,1/2,4.0,1152403200,A Moral Novel with a Mystery,"I read this book during a high school vacation. Although the long words and unconventional characters did not catch my fancy, the mystery involved in the story captivated me. As the story developed, I realized the profound intricacy of the plot. The conclusion of the story was not happy, nor did it even seem fair. As one who knows Hawthorne's puritan morality standards, however, I say that he communicated his message extremely well."
1741,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,A1PFPR44FLJNZP,Hitsugaya Toushiro,1/2,5.0,1151366400,Fascinating work of literature.,"I have just finished reading ""The Scarlet Letter""; before school ended, my english teacher gave most of her students a letter from our future AP English teacher, and it exhorted us to read two books for the summer: The Scarlet Letter and The Color of Water. I have not read ""The Color of Water"", but ""The Scarlet Letter"" is a wonderful story that should not be missed. Yes, Hawthorne may use sentences that are a trifle too long, but that does not really detract any of the genious from the book. I have a feeling that I will be one of the very few people (possibly 4) that will actually read the book; because, even though it will be an AP class, most of the students are quite apathetic.The book should be read by anyone that can appreciate it; it will improve your vocabulary (as it did mine). Hawthorne contrived to write an archetype of a classic novel that will last for many more years to come."
1742,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,A1ABDWJU9RTUWU,Rockinghorse Winner,1/2,5.0,1149033600,"Wow, what can you say?","Beyond brilliant, The Scarlet Letter is in another sphere entirely.This book is incredibly profound, deep, spiritual, eerie, and, in the end a soul-quickening experience. Hawthorne took the romantic, gothic themes popular in his day and transformed them into a new genre, the psychological novel. It may take a few readings, but eventually you will *GET IT* and when you do, you will feel a chill go down your spine. Hawthorne is delving into the psychology of evil, and the ring of truth is so strong it can be a moving experience. But as i said, it may take a number of readings before it hits you. It's kind of like those 3D drawings you must stare at until the picture resolves itself.Beside all this thematic content, Hawthorne is a master of the language, and his phrases are so delicious, I found myself repeating them just for the beauty of the expression. This book is to be read slowly, one sentence at a time. If you don't understand it, read it again. You will get it eventually.The plot itself is just beautifully realized. Many of the scenes are played out with real pathos and heartbreaking realism. Though, one can't discount the symbolism which abounds in this book.Someone has said that nothing really happens in the book. That is really not the case, but H does take numerous side trips into the minds of his characters. In this sense he prefigures the moderns like Joyce and Faulkner with their stream of consciousness technique. It is true that one often gets the feeling that time has been stopped, and we are in a moral realm that presses us on all sides until we feel claustrophobic and stifled. This is H's intent, to intimate the opressive moral imperatives, many societally coerced, that operate beneath the surface of our everyday business.While the book as a whole is a dreary, sad, almost mystical experience best read at night with a candle burning, the prologue is H at his most lighthearted. His descriptions of his fellow custom house employees are just delicious, and quite humourous. It makes a nice complement to the story. It is autobiographical up to the point where he finds the scarlet letter. That is a fictitious device he uses to introduce the novel. I believe the introduction (or prologue) was originally included to fatten up the book for publication. As it turns out, the prologue is one of H's best works, and should NOT be skipped! It can also be read on it's own.Finally, if you want more Hawthorne, try the short stories, *Young Goodman Brown* and *Ethan Brand*. They are deep meditations on sin written as allegories. Do not read if you are prone to paranoia or schizophrenia. ; )Hawthorne anticipated the psychology of the unconscious half a century before Freud, and his insistence on the connectedness between spirituality, psychology and physiology anticipates modern wholistic medicine. Plus, as I said, he is one of the greatest stylists who ever lived. You can not really understand America, unless you've read his works."
1743,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,AWIZE99KEJ3LV,"David Wilson Stager ""Kofi Annan""",1/2,4.0,1132099200,When puritans go wild,"I was not assigned to read this in high school, which is fortunate because I probably would have hated it back then. I used to think that anything written before the 1950's was too old to be entertaining. But, happily this book proved otherwise. Hawthorne writes with a poetic rhythm that kept me so absorbed that I was stunned to see how quickly I finished. The story is surprisingly relevent even today because of its thoughtful distinction between moral values and human compassion.A few things, however, kept this book from being five-star worthy, the first being the introductory chapter entitled ""The Custom House"". As eloquent as Hawthorne is, his words alone could not energize this ploddingly dull prologue. And speaking of eloquence, one occasionally gets the feeling that Hawthorne tries to lend too grand an air to unworthy subjects by forcibly inserting wordy descriptions. I had dictionary.com up constantly in an effort to decipher certain passages. Suffice it to say, my vocabulary nearly doubled after completing the book. One final, but minor, criticism concerns his excessive use of the words 'ignominy' and 'tremulous'. I admit, I got a little tired of seeing those on every other page.These faults aside, the book is well worth a read, and I would recommend it to anyone, provided one reads it freely of his/her own will and not out of necessity."
1744,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,A3KPJ9BWFQREMO,Amanda,1/2,3.0,1130630400,The Scarlet Letter,"The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a book to be read, but not certainly enjoyed. The plot, though interesting and unique, at times seems to drag on along with its characters and descriptions. Though it is a slow moving book, it is one that should be read for its insight on the past and how they compare to contemporary views.The story is about a woman name Hester Prynne who is living in a Puritan community in Boston during the seventeenth century. She has been forced to wear a scarlet letter A on her chest as a punishment for committing adultery and having an illegitimate child with an unknown man. Her and her daughter Pearl are forced to live as outsiders as Hester's husband, who is carrying a secret identity, is trying to unravel the truth of Pearl's father.Much time and concentration must be given to The Scarlet Letter in order to understand the text and meanings. When given attention, it will prove to be a good book. The plot is very thought provoking in how the life styles of the characters differ from people living today. Though it is a book that not many can relate to, it is an excellent portrayal of the past. Readers should be young adults to adults in order to grasp the sometimes difficult writing. However, it is a book that all should read at one time or another."

I thought that Hawthorne overexplained unimportant details. I really enjoyed the last 2 chapters, however, because it seemed more focused and there was some suspense. The novel is set in Puritan New England. Salem,Massechusetts to be exact. The main character is Hester Prynne, an adulteress who is forced to wear a pin, in the shape of the letter ""A"",made from scarlet colored fabric, hence the title. Her adultery results in the birth of her daughter Pearl. The man responsible for this is none other than the town preacher, although he keeps this secret hidden from his congregation. A complication in the plot is the arrival of Hester's husband from Germany. He is thought to be dead, and uses this to his advantage by disguising himself as Roger Chilligworth and becomes a physician in Salem. He vows to find out who Hester's lover was. The Scarlet Letter relates to Nathaniel Hawthorne's personal life, because of the setting. He spent a majority of his life in Salem, and claimed that the story originated from his discovery of a box containing the actual scarlet letter and a record of Hester Prynne while working in Salem's Custom House. Whether his story is true or not, it made me think of the novel as a real story, so I connected more with it."

Even better, the psychology of the characters is so finely drawn that it begs to be read again from cover to cover. Things are never neatly and unrealistically resolved, but continually appear in their full ambiguity, so much like real life. While not exactly a historical novel that depicts a period with total accuracy, it is one of the first great psychology novels ever written, and indeed is in a league with Stendhal in that respect. As this has been extrensively reviewed, I will leave plot descriptions to others.This is a classic that truly lives up to its reputation. Highest recommendation."
1748,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,,,0/0,2.0,916963200,Unengaging and Disappointing,"Like so many reviewers before me, I first read this book in high school. And, like so many readers before, I was sorely disappointed. How could this book have amassed such a legendary status in the canon of American literature?? The pacing is dreadfully, consistently slow, the characters are unengaging, the description is tedious, etc. For those of you out there who would defend these tactics, let me say one thing: while a good author would know how to use these literary techniques (as Hawthorne obviously does), a GREAT author would know how to use these techniques in MODERATION. What Hawthorne spends page after mindless page describing in agonizing detail, could have been summarized in just a paragraph or two of direct, memorable, grabbing prose.For those who still believe that this book is just too sophisticated for all of those dumb high schoolers, let me offer another example. In addition to The Scarlett Letter, my high school English classes also required us to read some other classic works of the English language, and none of these other classics brought about nearly as negative a response as the reponse brought about by this book. I remember that my classmates and I were by and large much more interested in the tragic story of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Heart of Darkness, Great Expectations, The Lord of the Flies, The Grapes of Wrath and The Great Gatsby were much better reads than The Scalet Letter ever was. Were these lesser books, because they were more accessible and often faster paced than The Scarlet Letter? I think not.As for all those people out there who profess a deep love of the book: although I'm sure that some of you actually did thoroughly enjoy this book, I fear that there are those of you who subscribe to the notion that just because something is labeled a literary classic, it must be good, and if it seems boring or longwinded, that's only the &quot;genius&quot; of it. Please don't blindly fall into this trap. Judge the book for yourself and forget about whether or not you &quot;should&quot; like the book.

As is usually the case, those who rated the book at one star don't have a clue as to what the story is even about; some haven't even finished the book! Nevertheless, there seems to be an alarming trend (to me, at least) toward reading Cliff notes as a substitute to actually reading the novel itself. I fail to see how anyone could even hope to understand the intricacies and subtlety that Hawthorne has woven into his greatest work through some watered-down retelling. (I don't particularly care for Cliff notes, but never mind that.) Being myself a high-school student, I feel that I must always try to represent the greater masses as something more than commonly believed, yet comments I have read lead me to wonder if the stereotypes are not more real than I have hoped. What I see when I look at the population is a group unable to understand and unwilling to try.To those who have lambasted &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; as being boring, slow, etc., all I can ask is that you not review books that you do not understand.

1751,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,,,0/0,4.0,915667200,Excellent Book,I read this book for my 11th grade Lit class and I must admit the book was quite a shock. Many of the books I have read have been nothing more than an attempt at delving into the inner parts of the human soul. This book does much more than that. It depicts the struggle of a man with himself and an outside enemy. He commits one of the most unspeakable acts of the time and punishes himself constantly. He lacks the courage to confess his crime and goes through a period of mental and physical torture. He also faces the wrath a cruel and vicious enemy who lives for nothing more than to torture his victim. All in all I believe it was an excellent book and I would reccomend it to anyone.
1752,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,,,0/0,4.0,915580800,"good book, though heavy","I am a junior in high school, and I just finished reading this book. Yes, the language and characters were stiff and formal, but at the time that this book was written, that was the convention. It is an excellent portrayal of the far reaching consequences of selfish sin, and the inner struggle that comes as a result of this sin. True, the characters had no depth, but this book was full of symbols and the characters are also symbols, representing different sins and evils, and the ways of dealing with said sins. The language does tend to bog down a reader, but remember that this was before authors began to write in the vernacular (Mark Twain, I believe, was the first) so the dialogue ends up sounding stilted and formal, especially from the children (Pearl, and the mudslinging ones). I personally did not like this book, but that does not mean that it was not an excellent work of literature. This type of book simply does not appeal to me, I prefer writers equally as thought-provoking but who write with more colorful prose, such as Dickens, or Salman Rushdie. The fact that I didn't like this book does not keep me from seeing the merit of it. It's an excellent book, though not quite a classic of the caliber of Macbeth or Great Expectations."

This novel is interesting and is a true look into the human soul. Hawthorne is not a humorous writer but he is a true to life one. He tells it like it is, including not only the strengths but the weaknesses of the human soul. Anyone who finds this book boring must be entirely niave or else the book was over their head.

The person who complains about something like that, obviously dosen't see the reasoning behind such a writing...and therefore lacks the necessary attitude to learn of such things. With that said... The character of Roger Chillingworth, (I thought), was one of great intrigue. His thought processes, and actions,(Even though they were morbid and evil) are all done with reason and intent. Unlike our dear Hester Prynne, who seems to run on emotion, like an old car runs on sulfer. As for the Rev. Aurthur Dimmesdale I believe him to be a self-centered hypocrite who finaly, does some actual good upon the end of the book. The story itself, is one of good writing and attention to detail.

Most people in today's society don't get pointed out for commiting adultery. It's like an everyday thing now. People just don't do that anymore. I do think that is was great to see how the people back then viewed certain quailties and how they carried out their religious beliefs. To me, this was a story about a woman named Hester Prynne who was caught up in a bad love triangle. She was married to a scholar who had sent her ahead to Boston. She got caught up and fell in love with the minster Dimmesdale. She got pregnant and had a daughter who she named Pearl because she was the most precious and expensive thing in her life. All of her earnings went towards her. They made Hester and baby Pearl sit out on a scaffold allday to let the people come by and look at them and ridicule them. Hester had to wear a scarlet A on her bosom from hence forth. She made the most of it, though. Pearl had an intuition and she could recognize how was good and who was bad. She knew the Chillingworth, Hester's husband, was a bad man. She felt a connection with Dimmesdale. One day when Pearl was about seven years old, she asked her mother what did the scarlet letter mean and why did Dimmesdale always cover up his heart. Hester had still not revealed who the father of her child was because she loved him that much. As far as I have read the guilt is eating Dimmesdale up and he wants to tell the people but he doesn't know how. In the end you should try your best not to keep hurtful secrets inside because in the end it will be the thing that destroy's you the most!"

I'm torn between saying it was the worst 3 weeks of my life or the most wasted 3 weeks of my life.The writing was drier than the 18th amendment, flowerier than a gay bar, and more boring than watching paint dry. Reading it was like reading the dictionary, but with a horrible plot and descriptions that are horribly specific.Additionally, I got the version WITHOUT the random house opening, and I STILL hated this book. If this is the peak of Hawthorne's literary 'genius', I don't want to read anything else he's written.The story itself has 24 chapters. About 20 of these are pointless and are just there for Hawthorne to flaunt his ridiculous writing style. In the end, the only things about the book that are even partway of a mystery are 1) Who adulterated with Hester Prynne, and 2) why Hawthorne even wrote this book in the first place.This book is the worst waste of ink and dead trees I've ever seen. If you're a person who heavily supports the eco-stuff, don't protest fossil-fuels, protest the use of trees to make this horrible monstrosity of human imagination put into words. I can't even imagine how Hawthorne lived with himself after writing this.During the weeks I read this, I experienced the only mood-swings I've EVER had. There's both a correlation AND a causation going on here. This is the literary equivalent of ""Crazy Frog""; it sounds like crap, and only insane people like it. This is not a book you read for fun. If you have read every book on your shelf/Kindle, don't even get this book for FREE. Buy something comical by an author who is underrated (I personally recommend 'John and the King' by Liam McMahon) and don't waste precious memory on this horror. This is the kind of book you read when a scary man with a big axe stands over you and says ""If you don't read something within ten seconds, it's curtains for you,"" and even then you look for something different.In the end, the only redeemable fact about this book is, if you order it paperback, then you're going to have a LOT of fun destroying it.BTW: here's the book I recommendJohn and the King (The Incredible Adventures of John)"

Lemon,5/7,2.0,1094601600,At least it's well annotated...,"This version (Modern Library) gets two stars because it is very well annotated. The book itself only deserves one star.Having now made it just more than halfway through this book, I have a theory as to why ""no one reads the classics"" anymore. It is probably because they were subjected to this turgid, boring book in high school, and came to the erroneous conclusion that all old books are this slow, long-winded, and tedious. How sad. Because of all the classics I have read (several hundred now), this is by far the slowest, windiest, and most tedious of them all.One of the first rules of writing is ""show, don't tell."" This rule has applied as far back as the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Book of Genesis. Well, Hawthorne is of the ""tell until you are about to lose your reader--then show you a bit to string you along"" school. He is wordy beyond description. His paragraphs are constructed of endless run-on sentences that have more side trips than a sorority girl's recounting of her weekend in Fort Lauderdale. In the first 43-page chapter, only three paragraphs have anything to do with the story (I'm not kidding).Once we get into the story, the pace picks up--but only slightly. We are presented with a series of long and endlessly wordy ""sketches"" that DESCRIBE the characters, their environment, and how they feel, and that bludgeon you with overt symbolism. We are TOLD all about the characters' internal and external conflicts, but we are SHOWN none of it. Again and again, I find myself thinking, ""This boring description could have been made into a really great scene."" Instead, I find my mind numbly wandering as I wade through deep rivers of slow moving prose.Just when I am about to give up all hope of action or plot and throw the book down in disgust, Hawthorne injects a brief snippet of dialog that (barely) keeps me interested. But sadly, he uses these moments to make his characters melodramatic and cartoonish.Some examples:The evil physician is twisted, misshapen, and deformed; his face is dark, and a fire burns in his eyes. He speaks friendly words with sinister, hidden motives. (I'm surprised he doesn't twirl his mustache, too).Or, the tortured preacher is wasting away under his own inner conflict over some sin he has committed. He is weakening and clutches at a pain in his breast. (Gee, which sin could it be? Care to guess? Hawthorne pretty well telegraphs it so you won't be surprised when it's unveiled).Or, Hester feels a searing heat beneath her scarlet letter, and her daughter shows impish, devilish behavior-the living embodiment of Hester's sin.Okay, okay -- we get the point.In short, this book sucks.If you want to read a great American novel that is loaded with symbolism, read Moby Dick. While it, at times, is also challenging, slow, and meandering; it is also deep, layered, complex, and structurally interesting, and it actually delivers the money shot at the end. Oh, Lord, how it delivers. With this turkey, the journey is so painfully slow and uneventful I'll never find out if it delivers. I just don't care enough to finish. I guess I'll have to watch the movie...If this is your first classic and you are getting discouraged, don't. Quit reading it and try another one. There are hundreds of great books out there. This isn't one of them."

To better understand the writer I also did a &quot;little&quot; research on him. That investigation gave me enough evidences to conclude that (as you can see in the SL) Hawthorne is better at creating ambiencies that at creating a solid, appealing plot, and more successful conceiving brief sketches of people and caricatures than at developing complete three-dimensional characters (since in the SL, the subconsious is well explicit to the reader, nothing being left to the reader to imagine). And why is this? Because even though Hawthorne is more commonly known as a novelist (due to his latter work, after the success of the SL), most of his legacy is composed of numerous short stories, and if you have the opportunity to read them, you will agree they are truly bewitching pieces of literature. But the fact is the literary &quot;establishment&quot; as always deemed short stories (as well as detective fiction)as lesser forms of literature. Hence, the focus given to this work of his, which may not be his better (but which evokes that &quot;ahead of its time&quot; aura some people seem to valorize so much in a book). So if you want to read Hawthorne at his best try his short stories (like &quot;The hands&quot;). But if you &quot;have&quot; to read this book, try to ignore its chronical lack of pace and the unevenness of the plot, whilst enjoing the little portraits of puritan life and those magical descriptive paragraphs where Hawthorne's imagination really soars high."

Hasnain ""~Enamored Soul~""",2/3,5.0,1299110400,The Scarlet Letter - An indication of Shame? or a testament to Love?,"Nathaniel Hawthorne, in writing The Scarlet Letter, took that which was considered so very taboo in the society and placed it in the household. He took a simple woman trying to escape her past, and a lonely man, who was also a preacher, and made them the models for the ""it could happen to anyone"" story.Many may say that Hawthorne's writing is full of glitches, is slow, and perhaps too ornate and verbose at times - but I disagree. In my opinion, he was an author who employed almost every literary technique, and used it well. The first chapter is probably the most difficult to get through, since it seems so detached from the rest of the book, but for those who are looking closely, it is full of foreshadowing elements and in reproducing the structure of the society in which the story is about to take place - Hawthorne is forewarning us of the limitations of said society, of how these rituals will come to be bane of Hester Prynne's existence, as the story unfolds.The story begins with Hester's public shaming,and her being made to wear a 'Scarlet letter' upon her bosom as a sign of her adulterous ways. Amongst the crowd, watching, is her husband Dr. Prynne, who now goes by the name of Roger Chillingworth. The plot is simple, Hester Prynne comes to live in a village near Boston, and there, she finds herself inexplicably for the town preacher. The town preacher, Reverend Dimmesdale, also falls in love with Hester. The husband, who was to follow Hester, a cruel and conniving man, is captured and considered dead which further fuels the level of intimacy between the Reverend and Hester. The result is an illegitimate child - although, Hester continually refuses to name the father of the child, for fear of the persecution that will result from this confession of her lover, the Reverend. While Hester remains ostracized from the society, her daughter and her both treated like the Plague, the Reverend wastes away with the guilt that he allowed Hester to take the entirety of the blame. He pines away for his love, and for his child, and becomes weak and disturbed. This only serves to add to the suspicions of Dr.Chillingworth, who is seeking to exact revenge on the man who had left his wife astray, and when he confirms his suspicions serves to fuel the Reverends self-hatred. The relationship between Hester and Dimmesdale is ever tender, but the relationship between Dimmesdale and his daughter Pearl is, although seemingly calm, tense and tortuous.Hawthorne paints his characters with such intensity, Hester's love and her patience, Pearl's innocence, Dimmesdale's self-loathing and guilt, and Chillingworth's jealousy and anger - and above all, the townsfolk's constant judgments. The novel is a classic, written in the way of a classic, full of eloquent prose, rich commentary and extremely descriptive. It is a slow and meticulous read, but also a very satisfying one. If you can get past the slow pace, and the alliterations and allegory, you will find yourself reading of a beautiful tale about love, passion, guilt, redemption...and above all, faith."

McCauley ""avid reader""",2/3,5.0,1288396800,It's a classic for a reason,"As an English teacher, I always look forward to the point in the school year when my students ask me to name my favorite book. Every year, I see their puzzled expressions when I choose The Scarlet Letter. Perhaps Hawthorne's masterpiece is out of place in our fast-paced world, our ridiculously simplistic culture where a book has no value unless Will Smith can play the hero in the movie version. If these criticisms of the novel are true, the fault lies with us, not with Hawthorne.The Scarlet Letter is a story of complexities - the complexity of love, the complexity of sin, and the struggle to find who you are in a society that demands conformity. How could anyone not identify with Hester, a woman whose only crime is in not covering up her mistakes as well as everyone around her does? How could anyone not sympathize with Dimmesdale, a man trapped between who he is in private and the mask he wears when he steps outside his door?That anyone can criticize the book as too wordy is beyond me. Saying The Scarlet Letter is terrible because there isn't enough action is like sayingTransformersis a better movie thanCasablanca. The details in the novel are there for a reason. Hawthorne is creating a world, a Garden of Eden, where the choices facing his characters are not as simple as the one facing Eve, though the effects are just as devastating.As a reader, if all you look for in a novel is ""who did what,"" then try the latest slop on the bestseller list. The characters will all fall into neat categories, there will be some painfully obvious moral, and best of all, you won't have to think. But if you want to read a story that forces you to define who you are and what you believe, try classics like The Scarlet Letter. Trust me, you'll find these books a more rewarding experience."

1786,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,AU3EFNKFCD484,Dane Roberts,1/1,5.0,1132099200,Landmark Literature,"I have a vague recollection of being forced to read this in High School many years ago. I just finished re-reading the Scarlet Letter. In my opinion, the Scarlet Letter would be out of reach for many teenagers - like it was for me. Now I'm older and wiser and have been reading classic literature in my bookclub for 15+ years. I have a greater respect for the SL and the new ground it was breaking in literature and I can appreciate the impact it had on future writers. In fact, the reason I picked up SL again was that I had learned that 'Moby Dick' - by Herman Melville - was was dedicated to Hawthorne. So that peaked my interest as I think MB is likely the best American novel ever written.I think adultry is still a big issue. Anything that's on the list of 10 commandments has pretty well served the test of time. Adultry is probably one of the commandments that many people have somekind of firsthand experience. So even though the story and characters seem archiac at times, many readers of SL can (or will) be able to identify with the guilt and angst at some time in their lives.So what about the guilt and angst? The parts of the story most interesting to me were the one's having to do with nature and the woods surrounding the small colonial village. The villagers were surrounded by nature along with the fear of the unknown. The Puritan settlers had brought with them their beliefs and systems into a new world that 'shielded' them to an unnecessary extent to nature and the laws of nature. It seemed like the Puritans carried a very heavy moral burden that most were nor equipped to handle. Hester turned to nature to get direction as the village had shunned her and left her with no options. One of best line's (I'm paraphrasing) is ""Let God be the judge, people need to learn to forgive each other and get along."" Hawthorne was in fact saying to the readers that these old 17th century Puritan beliefs were largely irrelevant by the late 1800's.So toward the end of the SL I found a connection that I was seeking between Scarlet Letter and Moby Dick - namely the scenes with the sailors and ship merchants - how they were not morally bound to the land - as were the settlers - and enjoyed a freer existence - and it was accepted by most people. I think this became a point of departure for Melville and his many books on ocean adventures.If you didn't like SL today, don't give up in literature as some of this stuff only gets better with time."

Morgan,1/1,5.0,1095465600,a sweet moral blossom,"Anyone who suffered through this book in high school, but has since developed a more mature intellectual curiosity and is willing to put in a little effort, will here find one of the most incredible rereading experiences the English language has to offer.A government official, his imaginative faculties deadened by years of dreary work in a Salem custom-house, shuts out the modern world and travels back in time two hundred years, using an old piece of emboidered fabric as a portal. Behold: a different world, the Puritan world, a dusky twilight zone between the Celestial City and the fires of Hell, where witches ride with Satan through the night air and the sky is a heavenly scroll with which God sends his chosen people messages via shooting stars. Here we become privy to a grim secret drama, a matter of life and death between three characters: Hester Prynne, beautiful, impulsive, conscious of her guilt and her mistakes, dutiful to her daughter and to the community who condemns her, and an expansive visionary amid the most closed-minded of people; Arthur Dimmesdale, the falsest person in the community, yet a devout religionist and believer in truth, who punishes himself with brutal acts of self-abasement; and Roger Chillingworth, the quiet man of learning whose devotion to scholarship does not prevent him from turning into a vengeful fiend.The Scarlet Letter is amazingly germane to our world: sexual transgression, single parenting, rebellious children, abusive authority, the importance of community and family, the clash of cultures, gender issues, etc. Yet it is as sometimes as weird as anything David Lynch or Thomas Pynchon could come up with: reality and fantasy, mirrors and hallucinations, sadism, masochism, witchcraft, dementia, UFOs, weird mystical symbols, nocturnal vigils, silent Indians, drunken sailors, ridiculous parades. A thoughtful reader will laugh hysterically at the dancing ape mentioned in Chapter 21. The narration is wordy but stylistically appropriate for Hawthorne's purposes; it finds a perfect balance between tongue-in-cheek irony and the seriousness of life-and-death issues. The book's reputation as grave and ponderous is the result of our inability--or more accurately, our unwillingness to take the time--to detect Hawthorne's subtly ironic tone toward his well-intentioned but sadly misled ancestors. His sentences are also longer than our diminished attention can sometimes handle, which is our flaw, not his.It is true that this story ""tells"" rather than ""shows,"" violating the ""show, don't tell"" rule of creative writing. Our interior worlds don't follow linear plots, and a writer like Hawthorne doesn't have to abide by such formulaic rules. This is a book for the ages, magic via the written word. Read it again, and slowly this time. Preferably by moonlight."

I disagree with an earlier reviewer that the book was boring. The description of the characters and of the situations they were undergoing was helpful. It made the story much stronger. The last three or four chapters were surprisingly suspenseful. It is a fantastic read.Moreover, ""The Scarlet Letter"" is a classic example of why social oppression is such a terrible thing. Thanks to the oppression of those times a child grew up without her father and a man died without ever having a real relationship with his daughter. One can't help but to think about the type of oppression (ie. sexual) that goes on today. This novel is a stark reminder of why oppression of any kind is really not worth it. When oppression exists in society, good people are always bound to suffer and all because of rigid, inhumane, socially conservative beliefs. Within its own context (Puritan era), the novel delves into this topic in a very powerful way. I highly recommend it because its subject matter still applies today."

It is a powerful book about sin and redemption, guilt and pardon, and revenged and forgiveness. I will let other reviewers deal with the great literary themes presented within this novel, but for this review, I want to look at Rev. Arthur Dimmesdale, Hester's lover and the father of Pearl.As an evangelical pastor, the character of Dimmesdale has always intrigued me. I can understand how godly men fail. I can understand how godly men can fall into sexual sin. Just because a man is called of God does not mean that he cannot fall for temptation, especially sexual temptation, became sexual temptation is common to all men. A quick survey of biblical heros makes this point clear. For instance, David, who is described as a man after God's own heart, certainly did not behave himself sexually. Aside from his adulterous affair with Bathsheba and the murder of her husband, David also, in addition to taking many wives, took to himself concubines for his sexual pleasure. One can argue all he wants about the cultural acceptability of such practices, but the fact remains that most Hebrew contemporaries of David did not take concubines, and although the Law of Moses does not directly address the concubine issue, the plan of God clearly states that God desires one man married to one woman for one life time.Back to Rev. Dimmesdale. Ok, the guy made a mistake. Two lonely young people fell in love and in the passion of the movement conceived a child. Sin happens. Even the godliest man can fail. The problem is not that he failed, but that Dimmesdale proved to be such a wimp about his failing. He allowed Hester (who was a better man than Dimmesdale) to bear the shame alone while neglecting his responsibility to his daughter Peal. Lets face it; this guy was a wimp, not a man. Why did he not accept responsibility for his actions and take care of Hester and Pearl? Instead, he sets on a course of self-destructive behavior that, in the end, leads to his death and abandonment of any responsibility to those whom he loved.Dimmesdale, get a life. Be a man. Quit whining and accept responsibility for your behavior- that is what a truly godly man does. Hester was a better man than Arthur any day."

Nathaniel Hawthorne is one of the best authors in all of literature, but he can really be one of the hardest authors to read. Once you pick up &quot;Scarlet Letter,&quot; do not turn away from his ample vocabulary. He is a really good writer and he knows what the reader wants to read about. Especially when he takes a woman and makes her the strongest of all the characters. I love his use of symbols throughout the novel, especially Pearl. She is one of the most captivating characters to read about. It is thought-provoking to sit and read about Puritan times and how things took place. I recommend this to anyone who not only has the time to read it, but also to those who enjoy a good story of what true love is all about."

Then, it was a dry, dull tale of a Puritan woman who had a penchant for a minister's black veil.Now, though, a few years later, it is clear that Hawthorne's seminal novel is more than just a tragic love story. It is yet another ""defining"" piece of literature, this time centering on Puritanism and its eventual decline, a decline clearly evidenced when the women first see Hester leave her jail cell, Pearl clutched close to her chest. The older women condemn her, but the youngest of them seems indifferent, an air of what could be understanding about her.Hawthorne's use of metaphor, symoblism, and the intriguing characterization of Hester, Chillingworth, and Dimmesdale as well as Pearl--who herself is a symbol of change and hope--serve to turn the mundane plot and two-hundred years of dust into an excellent work of art.We know who Pearl's father is, and the ultimate moment in the novel is not when Dimmesdale exposes his breast and reveals his own scarlet letter; it instead occurs during the juxtaposition of night and day, of Dimmesdale's refusal to admit his guilt, of Chillingworth's insidious insertion into Dimmesdale's trust.""The Scarlet Letter"" is not the best novel in existence, but it is worth the price of admission, and its overtones have an impact even today, addressing many social issues and resolving them in ways that echo biases and solutions of today."

I chose to continue it because I looked with sympathy, horror, and amazement at the protagonist, the priest, the physician, and the illegitimate child. There were moments when I was downright afraid of the child, Pearl, and convinved she must be demonic. I regarded Roger Chillingworth, the antagonist, as a generally benign, justice-seeking man. The protagonist, in light of her background, appeared to have little to defend herself with.But as the book progressed, it became apparent that Hawthorne had painted the portraits of characters more human than many of the people I know! Did Hestor Prynne utter words of (gasp!) sexual liberation? Or was that just my hindsight vision? Could Mr. Dimmesdale really be such a coward? Or was he truly a benevolent, if imperfect, man?In truth, regardless of what anyone else sees in The Scarlet Letter, I found a compelling story that encoruaged me to revaluate certain beliefs, and to enshrine others.

1793,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,,,1/1,5.0,1036886400,Read This Book,"This story is a moving representation of the dissonance that can be found between the human soul and society. Hester Prynne's suffering is painful because the reader understands that though she feels the sin of her actions, it is society that has condemned her. She must forfeit her freedom to walk as an equal citizen of Boston, never allowed to forget the silent agony haunting her every moment.It is not only Hester who is affected by social expectations and custom; it is eventually revealed to the reader that Hester's crime affects those who surround her, which tells us how much of an impact a individual's actions can have on another.Hawthorne's novel displays this fallen, detached member of Puritan society, but counters it with the revolutionist, the demon, the wild rose of Puritan lifestyle--perhaps hinting at the author's dislike for Puritan attitudes. Hawthorne reiterates these two devices: depicting his personal opinion through the actions of the characters and creating characters that refract each other.This is an amazing part of American literature, reflecting on human behavior and commenting on aspects of American history. How do people today act and react to each other, dominated by our culture's expectations? How are we self-serving or self-deprecating? A tip to readers: &quot;The Custom House&quot; (the book's preface) is dense stuff, quite possible of cultivating a strong dislike for Hawthorne as a writer, so I recommend saving it for last or skipping it completely.&quot;It is remarkable that persons who speculate the most boldly often conform with the most perfect quietude to the external regulations of society. The thought suffices them without investing itself in the flesh and blood of action.&quot;"

On one hand, I admire the brilliant analysis of Puritanical guilt that pervades the lives of Hester Prynne and the Reverend Dimmesdale. On the other, Hawthorne's writing often left me more irritated than I have been in a long time. ""The Scarlet Letter"" seems to me both a masterpiece and a crude dime novel at the same time.I don't question that Hawthorne's exposure of the moral dilemnas and guilt man faces is indeed well done. Every page is filled with the agony of the main characters. At the novel's best, ""The Scarlet Letter"" is spellbinding, simultaneously repulsing the reader and luring him/her onward.However, the novel suffers from several problems, not least the clumsiness of Hawthorne's prose. His sentences are needlessly complicated and repetitive. Unlike a Henry James, for instance, whose sentences are densely constructed, Hawthorne could have easily sliced the length down with no loss of meaning. The writing here is weak.Even more irritating is the lack of subtlety in the novel's symbolism. The symbols Hawthorne creates could be fascinating. However, when they're spelled out in blatant, crude detail, they lose their power. Hawthorne fails to show us his symbolic meaning, instead settling on telling us instead.So ... the novel is a worthwhile read, but it's a far cry short of what it could have been."

Hester is convicted of adultery, and her punishment is to wear a scarlet letter ""A"" on her chest for the rest of her life. Since Hester refuses to name the father of the child, and he doesn't come forward on his own, he goes unpunished, while Hester and Pearl become outcast in the town.

Chillingworth swears he will find out who Pearl's father is and get revenge. Meanwhile, the Reverend Dimmesdale, who is Pearl's father, is consumed with guilt about his sin and about the fact that he allowed Hester (and Pearl) to take all the punishment for it.I first read this book 20 years ago in high school and recently re-read it. I enjoyed it much more this time around. This is a very difficult book for a young adult to read. The pace is very slow, the vocabulary words are rather advanced, and the author is very wordy--he takes half a page to say something that could be said in one sentence. Those reasons are why I only gave the book 4 stars, instead of 5 :) Still, it's important to remember that the book was written over 150 years ago.Even with all those 'problems' the story itself is wonderful. It's a story of sin and the price that people pay for them, as well as the price that others are forced to pay for those sins. It's a story of guilt and the effect it has on you. It involves difficult decisions--do you admit your guilt and accept the punishment or do you hide it in an effort to still be in a position to do some good in the community? And do you forgive someone who hid his guilt while you accepted complete punishment?It is a book that makes the reader think about some very hard issues. And that's always a good thing."

The Scarlet Letter, written by Nathaniel Hawthorne, whose books explore the themes of guilt, is a striking romantic tragedy set in Puritan New England. The characters are well developed, each tinged with deep human emotion and conflict. The societal beliefs and superstitions of the people at the time provide Gothic elements. Again, one can make the argument that this is not only classic American literature, but Gothic romance.The Scarlet Letter revolves around Hester Prynne, a beautiful young early colonial woman who has recently ben married. Her husband has not yet arrived to the states from England (for some reason or other) and there is even rumors that he is dead. She loves the pastor of the community, Dimmesdale. Dimmesdale and Hester make love, committing the ""sin"" of adultery. When their relations are discovered through Hester's pregnancy with his child, the Puritan society they are part of are in an uproar. They immediately brand her as a sinner, an adultress and imprison her (she even gives birth in prison). As a reminder of her hell-bound deed, the elders sew a scarlet letter A (adultery) on her gown. She becomes a recluse, where she raises her daughter, Pearl, away from the people who have shunned them. Dimmesdale, is by far, the most troubled character. He is thoroughly immersed in guilt, and he must bear the hypocrisy of his crime. As a pastor, it is his duty to enligthen the people spiritually. He hides his sin, but punishes himself with physical torture each night, branding his own letter ""A"" with hot wax. The villain of the novel is not the Devil (who, contrary to the references made to the Devil, witches, etc) but the villainous Chillingworth, Hester Prynne's husband.Chillingworth returns from England to discover that his wife has become an outcast for her adultery. Full of raging jealousy and the desire to extract revenge upon the transgressor, he makes it his sole mission to torture Dimmesdale and plunge him further into dark despair with guilt. He feigns a friendship with Dimmesdale, but he makes it possible to mentally punish him and to inflict him with emotional pain. This is the real sin, here, the violation of the human heart. Through Chillingworth's constant torture of Dimmesdale, in addition to what seems like heavenly signs of condemnation (a comet passes in the sky leaving the letter A), Dimmesdale becomes so full of pain and guilt, that he dies in Hester's arms, announcing that he has committed the sin of adultery with her. The classic tale is read well and the cover is very striking. This can also make a nice gift."

After reading this novel, I learned a lot about love and adultery and how the people in the seventeenth century responded to it and dealt with it. The story takes place in Boston where a passionate woman named Hester Prynne goes off and cheats on her husband, Roger Chillingworth. While he was in England, Hester Prynne was having an affair with the pastor of the town, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale. Since he is the Reverend of the community, their love was to remain a secret even though they had brought a child into the world. Because Hester Prynne had committed adultery, she was forced by the townspeople to wear an embroidered letter &quot;A&quot; which was patched on her clothing right over her bosom. What you will read about in this novel is how Hester Prynne and Reverend Dimmesdale live through their struggles and what their daughter Pearl had to go through during her childhood. Be aware, it's intense!"

Take a few years and PLEASE TRY AGAIN! You will not be sorry. Hawthorne is a wonderfully subtle author, and while his writing might seem tedious at first, it will reward you. This is not just a book about adultery punished by a repressive society- it is about guilt and love, secrets and integrity, personal demons and responsibility. The story has true relevance in today's world. And Hawthorne's language is amazing. If anything he writes seems obvious, look again. He may not have said what you first thought. He often shows many sides of a situation and lets the reader draw his own conclusions. I never had to read The Scarlet Letter for school, but I have read it twice and will probably read it again soon. It is one of the few books that have really stuck with me and made me think. Like other great works of art, it will keep coming back to you. What it lacks in swift and exciting action, it more than makes up in the author's great understanding of and compassion for his characters."
1812,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,AK706I31EU9DY,"Nathaniel Hawthorne ""Maggie""",5/6,4.0,1096761600,Classic,"The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne, is a beautifully written controversial novel. It really highlights many of the problems of society during the time when the puritans had power up until present day society. The issues brought up include sexism, sexual morality, religion, and a line between what is considered right and wrong. Hawthorne shows the struggle of women in a society that is solely based on religion, the obstacles that have to be overcome in a situation of love vs. society, and the strength a single person can have to stand up for what they believe in when everyone else tells them they are wrong. Hester Prynne, the female protagonist, maintains many admirable traits and does not let society get the best of her. She comes to set up in Boston, which was then a puritan colony, while her husband takes care of business in Europe. While awaiting his arrival, Hester has an affair with Reverend Dimmesdale and falls in love with him. The consequence of this affair put restraints on Hester when she becomes `with child'. Society ridicules her and makes her wear an A(adulterer) sewn into her clothing so every person will scorn her because of her sin. An inspirational strength is shown in Hester when she wears the A like a badge of honor. This shows her overpowering the standards of society and that she is not ashamed of her actions just because people tell her that she should be remorseful. Hawthorne integrates many ideas together that make this novel intriguing. His word choice strings together pictures and feelings to the scenes in his writing. The situations that many of Hawthorne's characters endure are ones that many people can relate to today in the 21st century."
1813,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,A2HUXP2IH2JTNW,Alex Fitzwater,2/2,5.0,1309737600,Phenomenal Reading,"I had a friend who used this for one of her dissertations. If you're one who enjoys classic literature then there are few works that top this book. The symbolism of this relatively short novel gives Hawthorne the ability to write a story with an incredible amount of depth. One of my favorite things about Hawthorne is his focus on characters. The development of all the key characters is simply amazing! Grief and religious zeal are obviously major conflicts and themes in the work, but that's just barely scratching the surface. This is just one of those books that you can take so much out of and still find that there is more to learn about it.I'll warn you now, if you haven't already read this book, this is not for everyone. Hawthorne writes pretty densely, and so if you're not one who enjoys that style then look for a different book. He is known for creating very vivid scenes and part of that means that he spends a large amount of time describing the setting. If you don't mind to reading about what the room looked like or Hester's prowess with a needle then you'll find that Hawthorne weaves a lot of symbolism in with those descriptions.There is so much to say about this book that I don't know where to begin or end. It is a great work done in the spirit of early American movement of transcendentalism. Nature is a major component of this work while the corrupting tendency of society is demonstrated through the near-fanaticism of early American religious communities. THE SCARLET LETTER is a brilliant and powerful work. There are very few authors who are as capable of developing characters as believably, or effectively for that matter, as Hawthorne does and this work is his masterpiece in regard to character development. If you're interested in reading classic literature and don't mind that such books tend to be dense then this is a must read. There are so many layers to the book but the story line still maintains an extremely exciting structure. The last few chapters are simply brilliant in regard to power and emotion that they bring to the plot. This is a classic for a reason!"

So, when I finished the book last week and needed something to read, it shouldn't have been hard to pick something. I surprised myself by reaching for my Nathaniel Hawthorne collection and opening up to The Scarlet Letter.I read (or skimmed) The Scarlet Letter in high school. B-O-R-I-N-G! After I fell in love with The Peabody Sisters (which I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys biographies and literature) several years ago, I was anxious to try some more Hawthorne (he was married to the youngest Peabody sister). I started The House of the Seven Gables but put it aside when I just couldn't get into it after fifty pages. Even though I really really wanted to like Hawthorne, I figured it was hopeless.Perhaps I just wasn't ready or mature enough then. I devoured The Scarlet Letter this time. I was enthralled and fascinated with the story, themes and the beautiful language (makes reading most novels now seem like fifth grade work). I almost wish I was back in high school college so that I could discuss it with a group. I definitely have some ideas to contribute this time.

While it is true that some books overcome this at the time they are first read, others can take years before the reader is able to stomach reading them again. For myself, Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""The Scarlet Letter"" falls into that category. Though I had already come to respect the work again, I never got around to re-reading it until I saw it was available as a free download for the Kindle. As with all the free downloads, it is a bare-bones edition, but there is nothing wrong with that since the book stands on its own. Published originally in 1850, it is an historical romance which takes place in Puritan New England during the 1640s.The book opens with the somewhat autobiographical introductory work called ""The Custom House"". Of course it is also fiction in that he did not find a scarlet letter or the roll of paper which contained the story while working there. One could easily read the rest of the book without this section, but it does offer some insight into the author and his perspective.The story itself is well written, and Hawthorne integrates several major themes into the work, such as sin, guilt, punishment and foregiveness, etc., which add to the enjoyment. Also key to the story are the characters. Hester Prynne is the woman who must wear the scarlet A. Roger Chillingworth is her husband who comes to town from the Netherlands as Hester is being publically shamed, and he is determined to find and torment the father of Pearl, whom he determines is Arthur Dimmesdale, the respected minister who is torn apart by his guilt.At times Hawthorne has been bashed by critics, but at this point he has stood the test of time. Though I wouldn't consider him the great American writer, he is one who should be read and ""The Scarlet Letter"" is certainly his most famous, if not his greatest work."

Not to mention you could probably read half of each chapter and still keep up with the plot.Nonetheless, the themes are so strong it is no wonder The Scarlett Letter has been deemed a classic. The story tackles the issues of how one deals with his/her sins, and how honesty, for some, comes at the price of great shame.The novel does take patience, but it moves along at a very neat pace. Had the novel been written with more scenes, and less exposition, it could have been even more gripping.I read the Reader's Digest edition, which comes with about 12 lovely illustrations, which capture the essence and the mood of the novel.

The description of the little girl and how she copes with being ostracized with her mother by a rigid puritanical society, is especially moving.

Bass,182/217,5.0,968198400,&quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;,"Like many reviewers here, I was &quot;forced&quot; to read this book for my English Composition class. However, unlike many reviewers here, I have a much different view of the story. As some people have said before, Hawthorne's book takes a good deal of concentration, effort, and strength to understand. Not only to understand, but to finish. The story can drag sometimes, it is true, and Hawthorne's style of writing occasionally leaves something to be desired (I don't think I've ever seen that many commas, 15 letter words, or page long paragraphs before), but we simply must look past these minor issues. Overall, the plot is highly creative and intense, despite the writing.\Ok, ok, I agree that the first chapter, &quot;The Custom-House&quot;, was pretty bad. In fact, it was so bad and boring that I drifted off to sleep several times while reading it! The first chapter has little relevancy with the story, so, unless you have to, I would suggest skipping that part of the text. The rest is exceptionally good, and the quality of the plot cannot be overlooked. My advice is to just lay off the first chapter; that way you'll be able to enjoy the rest of the book without difficulty.The story itself deals with sin and adultery, a subject that isn't very popular right now. Hawthorne does an excellent job of telling us about this, but he leaves the reader with many questions floating around in his mind at the conclusion. At the end of the story you're not 100% sure if Hawthorne was condemning the Puritan society, or if he was commending it. He leaves that for the reader to figure out, which is a thing authors seldom do. That's a major reason I believe this work is so unique and timeless.The story involves a women named Hester Prynne, living in the New World in the late 17th century. She has committed adultery with someone unknown, and, since the Puritan society considered the Bible to be their ultimate source of law, the punishment was quite severe for such an act. Hester is forced to wear a scarlet &quot;A&quot; (for adultery) on her attire at all times, as a sign to everyone that she has sinned deeply. And so she must carry out the rest of her life this way. That's the major gist of the plot, although there's much more. I won't give it anyway, though, you'll have to read the book to find out.Let's face it: at some time or another we all are going to probably have to read this book, voluntarily or involuntarily. Shouldn't we try to make the best of it? Read it for its enjoyment, anything else would be missing the point."
1828,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,A32O0SCWAEM5RV,C. Chetty,84/102,3.0,1229212800,Intriguing and Creative,"The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne, takes place in the 1600s in Boston, which was a Puritan community at that time. The Puritans had extremely strict moral codes, and adultery, a subject matter in this novel, was deemed by the Puritans in the same way that felonies today are regarded. The novel's plot is directed by the Puritans' reactions to such behavior.Nearly all classic novels get praised for character ""development."" However, the Scarlet Letter is the only novel I have read so far that, in my opinion, truly demonstrates development of characters. All other novels I have read have ""exploration"" of characters, but not actual development. Development of characters involves portraying the changes in a person's personality as a result of conflict.In my opinion, the most impressive aspect of the Scarlet Letter is the ingenious connection between the novel's message and character development. In the Scarlet Letter, a single incident of adultery has unforeseen consequences that affect four people. How each character responds to the situation determines his or her physical and mental outcome in the story. The core message of the novel is that hiding one's sins causes more anguish than revealing one's sins.The character development is superb, but the novel does not seem to use the developed characters to influence the plot. The subject of adultery was a creative element to develop characters, but I wish that the author had introduced a different conflict toward the end of the novel to show how the 3D characters would have reacted to the change in subject matter. I personally think that varying the subject matter and conflict would have made the message even more convincing; however, the novel is written with a confident call to action, which is the MOST important aspect of any work of fiction.We live in a world in which immorality is everywhere, so a novel in which nothing inappropriate happens would be a pointless novel. Novels must address societies' immorality without sacrificing decency. Therefore, I commend The Scarlet Letter for referencing sexually immoral subject matter, without being a ""sexual"" book. This represents brilliance and should be observed by all writers of fiction.Many readers have complained that The Scarlet Letter is irrelevant to today's society. To some extent, I agree. However, the greatest novels written today will be irrelevant to society two hundred years into the future. Therefore, there is no justification for criticizing writers simply because their masterpieces will someday seem irrelevant. As time progresses, scenery changes, climates change, countries split up or join together, governments change, laws change, etiquette changes, etc. However, the elements of human personalities do not change with time. It is for this reason that I constantly emphasize the importance of characters. The Scarlet Letter's characters' personalities are thoroughly developed and distinctive, so they exist throughout today's world, as well as tomorrow's world."
1829,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,Dennis Littrell,19/21,5.0,1162771200,The first masterpiece of American literature,"""All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,"" might well be Nathaniel Hawthorne's theme in The Scarlet Letter. Certainly, by all community standards Hester Prynne's adultery is a sin. Worse yet Arthur Dimmesdale has triply sinned since he has had carnal knowledge of a member of his flock, and through a deep and abiding cowardice has failed to acknowledge his sin; and what is even worse yet, he allows Hester to bear the weight of public condemnation alone.However the worse sin of all belongs to Roger Chillingworth, Hester's husband who is not dead at all, but returned in disguise as a physician who has learned the efficacy of various medicinal concoctions from the Indians during his captivity. He pretends to befriend Dimmesdale in order to extract his long and torturous revenge. But it is Chillingworth's character itself more than anything that marks him as the worse of the sinners. He lives only for revenge and to give pain and suffering. He cares nothing for his wife and her child. He cares nothing for anyone, not even himself. He lives only to avenge.Dimmesdale's sin is that of a weak character. In a sense Dimmesdale is Everyman, the non-heroic. We see the contrast between the proud bravery of Hester and the all too human weakness of Dimmesdale who cannot bring himself to confess his sin, but looks to her strength to do it for him. We see this in the first scaffold scene as he pleads along with Chillingworth for Hester to reveal the father's identity. ""Reveal it yourself!"" we want to say.While some have seen Chillingworth as the devil incarnate--and indeed I suspect that was Hawthorne's intent--it might be closer to the truth to see him as the vengeful God of the Old Testament with his lust to mysterious power and his desire to see the sinful suffer. At any rate, Hawthorne's masterpiece--and it is a masterpiece, one of the pillars of American literature, to be ranked with such great works as Melville's Moby-Dick and Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn--is about sin and the effect of sin; and this is only right since the central tenet of Christianity itself is sin and the forgiveness of sin.By employing and investigating deeply three types of sin--Hester's from love and even something close to innocence; Dimmesdale's from lust, pride, neglect and cowardice; and Chillingworth's from hate--Hawthorne came up with a most felicitous device for examining the human soul.The Scarlet Letter is regularly taught at the high school level, but surely this is a mistake. The novel is difficult and challenging even for honors students. The architectured sentences, with their points and counterpoints, their parallel construction, their old school rhetorical cadences are strange and even wondrous to the modern eye. It is a good practice for the teacher and for the student to read aloud Hawthorne's prose so as to grow accustomed to his words the way one must for Shakespeare. If this is done and the edifice of Christianity and especially the fatalism of the Puritan mind brought to bear, then with leisurely pace and a steady concentration, the terrible beauty of Hawthorne's novel might be made immediate.Although the story itself is compelling, and the prose rich and poetic, the real strength of this great novel is in its characters. How true to life are all of them including even little Pearl who is defiant and willful in her beauty and her promise, so like a heroine-to-be of a modern novel. And how despicable and loathsome is this bent old man who embodies the very soul of the despised! And how attractive on a superficial level is this pretty young pastor whose actions are not the equal of his looks. And how strong and faithful and heroic is Hester who invites both envy and admiration, something like a flawed goddess of yore.What stuck me when I first read this, and remains with me today, is that it is those who presume to punish sin who are the real sinners. Chillingworth's life is one devoid of human feeling, devoid of any real joy as he lies in the stone cold bed of hatred and revenge. And to a lesser extent so it is with Dimmesdale who cannot forgive himself, who secretly flagellates himself so that his life becomes a hell on earth. On the other hand there is Hester who finds forgiveness and love with good works and in the joy of her beautiful and precious Pearl and in her unstinting love for Dimmesdale and her hope and faith that a better life will come.This is a deeply Christian novel although it is usually seen as a criticism of Christianity in the sense that the Christian community condemns the least of the sinners while the hypocrisy of its clergy is made manifest. Looking deeper we see that it is forgiveness of sin and the redemption that comes from good works that is exemplified. Hester knows the joy of life because she is a loving and giving person; and on another level she is forgiven because we the reader forgive her. How could we not? And most of the Puritan flock also forgave her since it came to be said that the scarlet ""A"" she wore upon her person stood not for ""Adultery"" but for ""Able.""It is also good to realize that when Hawthorne published the novel in 1850 the scene of the story was nearly two hundred years removed. Thus Hawthorne looked back at Puritan America from the standpoint of a more secular society greatly influenced by Jeffersonian deism and the transcendentalism of Emerson and Thoreau. In some respects, Hawthorne's brilliant treatment of the ageless theme of sin, guilt and redemption was a serendipitous, even unconscious, artifact of his literary skill. No artist composes a masterpiece without some deep talent at work independent of his conscious efforts."

Many of the reviewers' complaints are about the author's style, which is definitely an acquired taste. Hawthorne doesn't merely give you a scene; he tries to tell you what time it is, how and why it is happening, and what each character is thinking as they enter the room. In this way, this can be a turn off to a leisurely reader; it may even be a turn off to an avid reader. The bottom line is that The Scarlet Letter, maybe more so than any other classic, is definitely a matter of style. I tend to admire the book because I can over look some of Hawthorne's unorthodox styles and look for a deeper meaning; if you happen to feel this way, great, if not, then maybe it just wasn't your kind of book.The main subject in The Scarlet Letter is sin--but not only the sin of adultery (Hester and Dimmesdale). There is also the sin of jealousy and revenge (Chillingworth) as well as the sin of hypocrisy and gossip (Puritan community). Hawthorne's opinion of the hypocrisy of the Puritans seems to be illustrated in the opening scene with Hester coming out of the prison door we hear the Puritan women making besmirching comments about Hester, and one even wanting death for Hester because of her sin--this reaction from a do-good community! The main crux of the story though, as alluded to, is about Hester and Dimmesdale's sin of adultery, and, more importantly, how each of the two protagonists deal with their sin. While Hester's sin is spread out in the public eye of the New England community, and she is shamed publicly, Dimmesdale's sin is hidden, as no one except he, Hester and Chillingworth knows about it. In this way, there are two very paths that follow for Hester and the Reverend Dimmesdale. Hester, after her initial public humiliation and shame, begins life anew, and is able to find a hobby (that of a seamstress) to make ends meet, and her suffering seems to make her able to take on the challenges in life. She is able to deal with the questions and mischievousness from her daughter Pearl, and seems to implore Dimmesdale, who is obviously overcome with guilt, to forget their sin and live free. Dimmesdale, on the other hand, takes his sin very harshly, and not only feels he must punish himself for it, but physically becomes a shell of his former self. Still, Dimmesdale has a remarkable power to still give amazing sermons to the community, even with guilt. Chillingworth, Hester's ex-husband, enters the scene early in the book, and begins to ""peck"" away at Dimmesdale, knowing full-well that he can break him down mentally and physically with such a weight on his shoulders. During the scenes where Chillingworth is probing the mind of Dimmesdale, there seems to be a symbolic parallel between Chillingworth and the devil (there are several references to Chillingworth being the ""black man"" in the novel). Dimmesdale can't save himself physically, but he can spiritually. Hester emerges as the novel's hero, mainly because she sheds her former faults, and becomes a stronger person in the process.The Scarlet Letter is definitely ""heavy"" reading. It might take you a few times to get through a few of the chapters. But, alas, persevere, and you may find it worth reading. And, take some advice: skip the introductory chapter ""The Custom House"" and just begin reading with ""The Prison Door."" I can give you a quick synopsis of the introduction: Hawthorne wrote a book about two people who sinned by committing adultery, and the Puritans weren't happy. As much as people say this book is outdated, it really isn't. I mean, public scandals are a part of our culture just as much as they were then. Hester Prynne is that public scandal, the story you hear on the news or other media outlets. Public infamy, as well as changing public perception, seems to never go out of style.3 stars"

It has been almost five years since I have read this book and I can remember the scenes and words so vividly. Hawthorne's dizzying imagery provides an adventure into the life of a Puritan woman, Hester Prynne, that one does not soon forget.Hester, practically abandoned by her husband is left to take care of herself in a lonely new world. She is flesh and bone with desires and passions like any other human being. Hester commits adultery and is found out by a cruel, judging community. She must wear a Scarlet A on the front of her dress; A for Adultery. Hester refuses to give the name of her lover Dimmesdale so he goes free and untouched by the damning society, but must face the tortures of his own conscience.Hester is humiliated and must suffer the consequences for her actions but she is not a broken woman.

1833,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""",19/22,5.0,1040428800,An intense human drama that transcends literature itself,"The Scarlet Letter is truly one of literature's greatest triumphs, its characters and themes reverberating in our collective consciousness more than 150 years after its initial publication. Few novels inspire as much contemplation and feeling on the part of the reader. Hester Prynne, American fiction's first and foremost female heroine continues to haunt this world, inspiring a never-ending stream of scholarly debate. Even in our less puritanical age, some doubtless see her as a villainously great temptress, but to me she is a remarkably brave hero indeed. Her sin is known to all, and she never runs away from it, bearing the scarlet letter on her bosom bravely for all to see; she realizes the true measure of that sin, fretting constantly over the effects it will have on young Pearl, remaining steadfast in her beliefs while at the same time envisioning a new society where women and men can exist on more equal terms, free of the stultifyingly harsh punishments meted out on even the most repentant of souls by Puritanism. She shows her noble spirit by refusing to name her partner in sin and goes so far as to allow the ruthless Roger Chillingworth to torment the man she loves deeply enough to protect him for all time. Little Pearl is somewhat of an enigma, truly manifesting traits of both the imp and the little angel; her questions about the letter her mother wears and the minister who continually holds his hand against his heart reflect an insight that amazes this reader. Chillingworth is a thoroughly black-hearted man; I can certainly understand the blow he sustained as a result of Hester's sin, but his actions and thirst for prolonged revenge on the so-called perpetrator of the wrong he suffered can only be described as roguish and unpalatable.Of course, the most complex character in the novel (and literature as a whole) is the good minister Arthur Dimmsdale. One is compelled to both like him and despise him. He is basically a good man and an unquestionably fine soldier in the army of the Lord, winning many souls to God with his impassioned sermons. He is more aware than anyone else of his sinful nature, and he punishes himself quite brutally in private in a useless attempt to make up for the public ignominy he lacks the moral courage to call upon himself with a public profession of his deed. Dimmsdale is a coward and a hypocrite. At one critical moment in the latter pages of the novel, he blames Hester for his state of misery, and it is that comment in particular that makes this tragic character a man I can only commiserate with to a limited degree. Even at the penultimate moment of the novel, as he finally bears the mark of his shame and guilt for all his parishioners to see, the very men and women who have viewed him as a saintly man of God rather than the brigand he knows himself to be, he does not openly confess-his words and deeds do make plain the secret of his heart, but it is his lack of a thoroughly bold confession that causes some of his most devoted followers, so Hawthorne tells us, to blindly judge his final act as an illustrative parable on the danger of sin threatening each member of his congregation rather than an admission of guilt and self-condemnation.It upsets me to see readers who do not appreciate this novel as one of the earliest and best American classics, a novel that contributed greatly to the establishment of a literary culture in the young country. The language is of a more florid style than today's readers are used to, but this novel is in no way boring. Hawthorne paints some of the most vivid scenes of human drama I have ever witnessed; he writes in such a way that you are there in colonial Boston watching the story play out before your very eyes, struggling to come to terms with your own feelings in regard to such complex and sometimes inscrutable characters. The climactic chapter is truly and deeply moving, more than capable of bringing tears to the eyes of the sensitive soul. The Scarlet Letter is just a brilliant, gripping, thoroughly human novel that I wish everyone could appreciate as much as I do."
1834,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,A1ARA52HB238HT,"Matthew M. Yau ""Voracious reader""",21/25,5.0,974851200,Scarlet Letter Review,"One of the American classics, THE SCARLET LETTER tells of a woman named Hester Prynne in late 17th century who committed the then-unforgivable sin of adultery. She had been living in Boston for two years and had been found guilty of bearing a child (Pearl) by an unknown father. As punishment for her sin, Hester was forced to wear a scarlet A (adultery) on the bodice of her dress and to stand on a public scaffold before Boston's townspeople.The opening chapter &quot;Custom House&quot; seemed irrelevant to the rest of the novel the first time I read the book. It was not until a couple of years later I found it not true when I re-read the novel. I do have to admit that Hawthrone's writing style can drag at times, the once-seemed boring opening chapter significantly set the mood for the rest of the novel.&quot;Custom House&quot; does not seem to be an integral part of the story; yet the passage in which Hawthrone tells of having discovered, in the Salem Custom House, the faded scarlet A and the parchment foolscap sheets containing the facts which he says he used as the basis for this novel. The two landmarks mentioned at the beginning: prison and cemetry, point to the central themes of punishment and death, which will be combined in the climax of the novel. Prison might symbolize how Hester Prynne, who wore that scarlet A on the bodice, was forever locked in by her sin.This entire tale is filled with symbolisms. The prison is described as &quot;the black flower of the civilized society&quot;. The tombstone at the end of the book implies that crime and punishment may well bring about the death of such civilized life. The most popular and conspicuous symbol that is well sustained throughtout the book is the scalet A that is worn by Hester Prynne. Initially it is a red cloth letter which is a literal symbol of the sin of adultery. But the author makes the symbol A much more richly symbolic throughout the rest of the tale. The scaffold is not only a symbol of the stern Puritan code, but also a symbol for the open acknowledgment of personal sin. Night and day are symbols for concealment and openness. The sun symbolizes happiness and freedom of guilt. The list goes on and on....Arthur Dimmensdale, Roger Chillingworth, Hester Prynne, and Pearl themselves, are symbols as well. They reflect certain view of sins and effects on humans and society. The book might take strength and effort to read; but it's not quite a bad read."
1835,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,A1L8ZNH8EHVR40,Tricia Love,14/16,5.0,1190332800,This is when I fell in love with Nathaniel.......,"Just look at a portrait of him as a young man, note the noble brow, the handsome features, the sensitivity, how romantic......... Curl up with this book and let Nathaniel tell you his tale in his beautiful poetic language . This is a book to be read quietly, alone, not in an airport lounge or on the subway, but preferably in a beautiful garden or sunroom with the windows open. Let the beauty of his language flow over you and transport you back in time.It is over 200 years since Nathaniel Hawthorne was born in Salem Massachusetts, his great great grandfather officiated at the Salem Witch Trials. He was both disturbed and intrigued by his ancestry. One day when working at The Custom House in Salem to make ends meet as a struggling young author, he discovered in one of the upstairs rooms some dusty old boxes, on opening them he found them to contain relics from the past, long since forgotten. Yellowing documents and an intriguing piece of embroidery, a scrap of faded and torn material with the letter A embroidered on it. He picked it up, and while wondering what it was, he held it up to his chest, and at that moment he claims to have felt a burning sensation which caused him to drop the piece of cloth. It gave him inspiration for this story along with documents he found about a woman called Hester Prynne.The scene he sets so vividly is somewhere around 350 years ago 150 years before he was born. In a time when behavior to which we can hardly be bothered to raise an eyebrow was in that day considered a punishable sin. A disgrace for life. Branded by having to wear a scarlet letter on the chest for all to see.It is a feminist novel, (Nathaniel Hawthorne supported women's rights). Briefly, the protagonist Hester Prynne has a child from an adulterous relationship and refuses to name the father. Her husband a physician much older than she has never been a ""proper"" husband to her so she had looked elsewhere for love. The husband vows to find the father of the child, and in exchange for her freedom makes Hester swear she will never disclose who her husband is. Her husband being a physician quickly deduces who the father is from the way he is wasting away under his burden of guilt. He sets about a long period of torment of the young man of which Hester is aware but can say nothing because of her promise. Finally she has had enough and decides to come clean, shaming the devil, (her husband) and redeeming the young man. I do not want to spoil anything by divulging the name of the father of the child in case you do not know.This is such a simple and brief account it would make Nathaniel wince to read it. There is so much more to the story. It states in the blurb that it is a psychological novel before there was a science called psychology. The way the characters in the story interact with each other, the symbolism, the different values of the day from Nathaniel's day, and then again to this day. The religious aspect in Puritan times, the emotional ups and downs as you empathize with first one and then another of the characters. It is a wonderful story and well deserving of its position as one of America's great classics."

There was a lot of lengthy description in the book that was a little hard to follow. The novel didn't really &quot;come alive&quot; for me- I was too busy trying not to get lost in the descriptions. On the other hand, the book/writing does a good job of portraying human nature and human feelings.

1837,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,,,2/2,5.0,914630400,Perfect For High-School Students -- If They're Ready.,"I just finished reading this book (found a copy on the internet) and must say it was quite a story. I think readers young and old can enjoy this book, but if you're in high school and your school has only fed you those soppy, milktoast pieces of so-called English lit, I must tell you that you should probably look elsewhere for Winter Break reading. On the other hand, if you're a somewhat linguistically precocious high school student and are well-acquainted with other authors of this genre, you will find this book a quick read and beneficial to your high school studies for a number of reasons. One. You will now understand those vague references your friends make when they call you Hester Prynne under their breath. (okay, so maybe that's just me.) Two. All that Puritanical &quot;nonsense&quot; from American history will make a heck of a lot more sense now that you understand in a more emotional sense what impact Puritan morals had on gender roles in colonial New England, etc. Three. Your English teacher will appreciate the fact that you went out of your way to read something that wasn't Tom Clancy or Michael Crichton. Four. If you've been having a hard time with your college app essay, you now have a great topic for the one about who you'd like to meet and why. (Pick either Hawthorne or Prynne -- but please, be intelligent.) Anyhow, if you've got over two brain cells, this book is an intense and very speedy read. And you're not likely to confuse it with any other literature, like I so often do with Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility or Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. So read this book. You'll be glad you did."

Schwartz ""romonko""",4/5,5.0,1105920000,Wonderful Story About Early American Puritans.,"Nathanial Hawthorne is a wonderful writer, if gloomy. I have read quite a few of his books because of how much I enjoyed this one. This is his masterpiece, although some of his other books are worth a read as well. This book is chilling because of his mastery of language and characterization. He explores sin, alienation and spiritual regeneration as he tells the tale of a Puritan woman (Hester Prynne) who has an adulterous affair with a minister. We see the ripple effect that this illicit affair has on Hester and her lover, as well as Hester's husband, and most disastrously, her daughter Pearl. We see the effect that being ostracized has on Hester herself. This is visibly pictured by the scarlet A that she is forced to wear, but the effect that this has on her psyche and the way that she finds to cope with this estrangement show how strong a human being can be if pushed to it. This is a great book, and I recommend it highly."
1840,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,A1FZI1F22GRO4C,Richard Veysey,4/5,5.0,1103673600,One of my favorite books,"I read the Scarlet Letter last year for English and found it to be one of the most increadible stories I have ever read. Symbolism abounds in the forms of Pearl and Chillingsworth; even the scenery comes alive to tell this tale of love, atonement, and revenge.Don't come into this book looking for action, there isn't any. Instead, there are intense mental conflicts between the characters, making for some exciting and powerful scenes. Hawthorne's uses a great deal of description, mostly to create symbols, but also just to allow you to imagine yourself in the time and place: puritan New England, so that you can empathise more with the brilliantly designed characters.If you aren't familiar with the story of the Scarlet Letter, it describes the punnishment of Hester Prynne, a woman charged with adultry and punished by having a red letter 'A' sewed onto her main article of clothing. She is a marked woman, and therefore raises the daughter from her affair in a house seperate from the rest of her village. Her husband, who was supposedly following Hester to Massachusets from England, but took a long time getting there, arrives to witness her punishment, and decides that he is going to find the man who did this and make him suffer. From there, Hawthorne brings his characters together through scene after powerful scene, until the amazing ending.The Scarlet Letter is a classic for a reason, and deals with many issues that we still wrestle with today. If you're a fan of symbolic books, don't mind books which lack action, and want a book which will make you think, I recomend the Scarlet Letter to you. If you want the action and not the symbolism, then you probably shouldn't be looking for classic books, especially not this one."
1841,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,A17M8NUNZOMELA,BamaGirl70,4/5,5.0,1093046400,Prose fit for a Puritan,"How could anyone call the plot of this timeless story mundane?! This story is timeless as anyone in our age of technology who has had a baby out of wedlock can attest to the social ignominy they immediately endure, whether by their own church or by the Puritan bred society we live in. Some things do not change. The central figure Hester Prynne must stand on the public scaffold with her fatherless child and endure the silent reproach of her peers and town fathers, putting on a good front of indifference while also serving as a means of perverse entertainment for the crowd gathered round. Hawthorne makes the public shame of the scaffold felt in his rich skill with words that resurrect the cold, disapproving world of the Puritan. The Romans had the colliseum, the Puritans had the scaffold! Some will find the reading heavy, bogged down with a rambling of words. Others who want to rekindle what it meant to tell a story in Victorian times will enjoy the rich prose, each sentence carefully composed to the point the reader feels Hawthornes throbbing pity for the fallen Hester Prynne and her undisclosed lover- which will remain so here in case anyone has not read the book yet. The narrative voice is one of sympathy for the doomed lovers and the innocent child Pearl, and at the same time one of grudging empathy towards the Puritan fathers who given the age, did only what they felt was right in condemning a woman of wicked ways, but not so wicked that they stop purchasing her fancy laces and superb skill with the needle. The hypocrasy of the Puritan way of life is easily discerned within three chapters. Hawthorne's own grandfather had been party to the Witch Trial period, having sat in judgement over a woman condemned to hang. His interest in the human turmoil the strict Puritans must have endured is evidenced in his writing of the poor Rev. Dimmsdale, caught between the dark presence of the physician Roger Chillingsworth's snake like vigil, the blind devotion to him from the townspeople as a living saint, and his desire to help Hester Prynne, clutching at his own heart everytime she passes by with the Scarlet Letter emblazoned upon her chest. This is well worth taking the time to read. Think of those long passages as sitting in front of the fireplace with Hawthorne as he unravels his tale for you, his desire to make you sympathetic to the lovers inciting his lengthy descriptions. A must for any age reader."
1842,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,AB9WCN34TY8CV,Charles Sutherland,4/5,5.0,1057536000,A Scarlet A-plus!,"I remember reading this novel back when I was in high school, and again recently when there was another film version of it done. It really is a classic tale, set in early America. However, the moral of the tale is rather timeless -- it deals with sexual morality, but more importantly it deals with honesty and corruption in society, and how we can really harm ourselves by trying to live up to what society wants from us.Hester Prynne is the main character. In a Puritan community, she breaks her marriage vows by having an affair, with the new preacher no less, Reverend Dimmsdale. This affair results in a pregnancy, something that is impossible to hide in the small community. Reverend Dimmsdale becomes both her lover and her chief accuser, given the status he has in the village. The entanglements that Dimmsdale and Prynne have with each other, in public and out, make for fascinating reading, and shows that people remain the same essentially no matter how technology and history may change.The title, the scarlet letter, refers to the big red ""A"" Hester Prynne is required to wear, identifying her as an adulteress. Interesting, of course is that while the whole community is full of sinners, because Puritan religion believes this of all people, they single her out. This also shows times don't change, because even today sexual ""sins"" are often considered worse than far more bloody or violent ones.This is a well written book, not really easy but not really difficult to read, and a fascinating look at both early America and how people interact."

But when I read this book and a number of the author's short stories I couldn't escape the conclusion that Nathaniel Hawthorne wasn't a great writer. He doesn't belong among the immortals of literature. His short stories are predictable. After reading Hawthorne I read some Herman Melville and found him to be far better. The one thing in Scarlet Letter's favor is that it is politically correct. It's satisfying that the intolerant religious fanatics are the bad guys. The villain of the story is respected Roger Chillingworth, and the heroine is his wife Hester Prynne, adulteress. Would you consider it adultery if the husband was missing for years and assumed dead, as is the case here? It's not enjoyable to read about religious intolerance. The book gets quite dopy when something magical happens to Hester's boyfriend at the end, something right out of The Exorcist, and typical of Hawthorne's silly writing. It gets even dopier when Hester deserts her happy family to return to misery. Hawthorne has a thing for magical events and foolish endings."

In fact, I have never read any of Nathaniel Hawthorne's works before--doesn't say much for my high school. Hawthorne's use of imagery and double meanings captivated me. ANALYSE ANYTHING--EVERYTHING HAS ANOTHER MEANING. I couldn't wait to read the next page and get to class to discuss it. When I read the passages again, I found more hidden meanings. I've gone on to read more of his works since and would now like to find out more about his family heritage. His family was involved in the Salem witch trials and the persecution of the Quakers during the 17th century. It has been suggested that this has influenced in his writings about guilt, shame, sin, &amp; alienation.I loved his allegorical treatment of the emotional ramifications brought on by social, family, and religious situations. What was chillingworth's sin anyway? Who cheated on who? I would say that the &quot;goody-two shoe&quot; minister, Arthur Dimmesdale, was the real villain. He never confessed to save Hester and Pearl until his dying day; he had nothing to personally gain by keeping his secret.I &quot;feel&quot; for all the high school kids that do not appreciate or understand Hawthorne's stories. I suggest that you go to a quiet place, without interruptions--take the phone off the hook, and read. It will take time to get going; a little research would help. Coming to this site is a start.

As Hawthorne and Melville were friends, I didn't think that Melville would mind.While I read and taught The Scarlet Letter before, I never had the appreciation for it as I did in this reading. I was captivated by the story, but the language and style of its writing was preeminent for me. Hawthorne crafts a beautifully written story that tells the familiar tale of Hester Prynne's public shame and Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale's private tormented guilt after an adulterous affair set in the backdrop of Puritan Boston. The story is simple, as Hester faces a judgmental crowd in the town, and Dimmesdale suffers from a burning conscience as he does not admit to his sin. One man, Roger Chillingworth--Hester's husband--knows the secret and is bent on revenge against them both.While The Scarlet Letter is often used to criticize and demonize the Puritan era, it rather shows the importance of what the consequences of sin lead to within our hearts. The public consequences are temporary, but the private consequences are far longer reaching as the ""Hound of Heaven"" chases after us to confess and repent. While Hawthorne does not condemn adultery as a sin, we see the destruction causes by infidelity with the Prynne family. Hester Prynne is indeed a model of feminine strength and virtue in accepting responsibility and guilt, but she also provides us a picture of the results of our sin and the need for redemption in a Savior.The book begins with this excellent line, showing the coldness of the scene and the tone of the entire novel:A throng of bearded men, in sad-colored garments and gray, steeple-crowned hats, intermixed with women, some wearing hoods, and others bareheaded, was assembled in front of a wooden edifice, the door of which was heavily timbered with oak, and studded with iron spikes.In our first picture of Hester, Hawthorne contrasts the ugliness of sin with the beauty of the woman:On the breast of her gown, in fine red cloth, surrounded with an elaborate embroidery and fantastic flourishes of gold thread, appeared the letter A. It was so artistically done, and with so much fertility and gorgeous luxuriance of fancy, that it had all the effect of a last and fitting decoration to the apparel which she wore; and which was of a splendor in accordance with the taste of the age, but greatly beyond what was allowed by the sumptuary regulations of the colony.If you are looking to read novels that you should have read in high school but didn't, I heartily recommend starting with this one."

I thoroughly enjoyed the book then. Going back and rereading a second time still brought back the awe associated with the imagery painted by Hawthrowne. Perhaps the most striking image is that in the beginning, where Hester Prynne is about to come out of her jail cell and a single rose blossoming amidst the bleakness of her prison is used as a metaphor. Hawthrowne does a superb job describing the details and ways of life. I believe he captures 17th century Bostonian life accurately. In a way this book is a history book. I do admit that the plot is slow at times, but the book does appear to move much more quickly if you try to admire Hawthrownes writing style and descriptive language. Overall, I would say this book impressed me as much as War and Peace and some of Dickens' novels did."

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""",0/0,5.0,1307491200,The letter was her passport,"When people think of a ""scarlet letter,"" we immediate think of a person outwardly branded for something they have done. Credit Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""The Scarlet Letter"" for that -- it's an intense, impassioned (if slightly hammy) story of a strong-willed woman in Puritan New England, who is branded for her sins and her love for one weak man.In the mid-1600s, a passionate young woman named Hester Prynne has been accused of adultery -- she recently had a baby, even though her husband was abroad. Just as damning to the elders is the fact that she won't name baby Pearl's father. Even her estranged husband -- a cold-hearted older man calling himself Roger Chillingworth -- wants to know her lover's identity, but Hester steadfastly refuses to even hint at the man's identity.We learn early in the book that Pearl's dad is actually the local minister Arthur Dimmesdale, who is wracked with guilt, hallucinations and sickness because of his secret adultery. Chillingworth slowly deduces who his wife's lover was, and begins to scheme revenge on Dimmesdale. Will the former lovers manage to escape their guilt-ridden lives, or will they reveal the truth to everyone?It sounds like ""The Scarlet Letter"" is JUST a story about guilt and sin, but it's also a story about love and steadfastness. Hester remains strong and kind throughout her life despite others' cruelty to her, and her love for Dimmesdale and Pearl is what gives her that strength. Chillingworth (symbolic name!) is a cuckold, but it's impossible to like him because of his lack of love -- he loves no one, and lives only for revenge.And at the same time, Hawthorne reminds us that goodness can overcome your past sins. Hester slowly overcomes the Puritans' loathing for her by simply being charitable, kind, helpful and loving, until eventually her sin is eclipsed by her virtues. On the flip side, Dimmesdale is annoying because of his weakness and cowardice -- I know he's supposed to be wracked with guilt, but he's so pathetic compared to Hester that it's just infuriating.Hawthorne's writing may take a little while for modern audiences to get used to. It's very 19th-century in style, with staid, slightly stuffy prose gilded with hauntingly poetic moments and intense passion (""Never, never!"" whispered she. ""What we did had a consecration of its own"").

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""",0/0,5.0,1306368000,The scarlet letter was her passport,"When people think of a ""scarlet letter,"" we immediate think of a person outwardly branded for something they have done. Credit Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""The Scarlet Letter"" for that -- it's an intense, impassioned (if slightly hammy) story of a strong-willed woman in Puritan New England, who is branded for her sins and her love for one weak man.In the mid-1600s, a passionate young woman named Hester Prynne has been accused of adultery -- she recently had a baby, even though her husband was abroad. Just as damning to the elders is the fact that she won't name baby Pearl's father. Even her estranged husband -- a cold-hearted older man calling himself Roger Chillingworth -- wants to know her lover's identity, but Hester steadfastly refuses to even hint at the man's identity.We learn early in the book that Pearl's dad is actually the local minister Arthur Dimmesdale, who is wracked with guilt, hallucinations and sickness because of his secret adultery. Chillingworth slowly deduces who his wife's lover was, and begins to scheme revenge on Dimmesdale. Will the former lovers manage to escape their guilt-ridden lives, or will they reveal the truth to everyone?It sounds like ""The Scarlet Letter"" is JUST a story about guilt and sin, but it's also a story about love and steadfastness. Hester remains strong and kind throughout her life despite others' cruelty to her, and her love for Dimmesdale and Pearl is what gives her that strength. Chillingworth (symbolic name!) is a cuckold, but it's impossible to like him because of his lack of love -- he loves no one, and lives only for revenge.And at the same time, Hawthorne reminds us that goodness can overcome your past sins. Hester slowly overcomes the Puritans' loathing for her by simply being charitable, kind, helpful and loving, until eventually her sin is eclipsed by her virtues. On the flip side, Dimmesdale is annoying because of his weakness and cowardice -- I know he's supposed to be wracked with guilt, but he's so pathetic compared to Hester that it's just infuriating.Hawthorne's writing may take a little while for modern audiences to get used to. It's very 19th-century in style, with staid, slightly stuffy prose gilded with hauntingly poetic moments and intense passion (""Never, never!"" whispered she. ""What we did had a consecration of its own""). At times Hawthorne's story gets a little... hammy (such as Dimmesdale revealing his ""A"" burn scar), but the power of his story keeps this from getting silly.""The Scarlet Letter"" is used to describe outward signs of guilt, but Hawthorne's novel is actually about strength and love, and how they can blot out misdeeds."

The author wrote about Hester and Pearl in a way that helped them attain emotional sentiment from the readers. Also, Hawthorne showed the physical and psychological effects of having a guilty conscience by writing about what Hester and Dimmesdale had to endure to hide their sin. The author also successfully showed the hypocritical aspects of Puritan society in Boston, Massachusetts during the mid-seventeenth century. For example, Dimmesdale still remained a religious minister and role model for the rest of the townspeople even though he was responsible for a forbidden affair with Hester. A main purpose of The Scarlet Letter was to show that human beings can be misunderstood if they aren't allowed to have personal identities due to strict societal regulations. In this novel, the author, Hawthorne, portrayed the idea that Puritanism often lead to unjustified punishment, sometimes against the wrong person. Throughout the novel, he draws strong criticisms against Puritan values.The Scarlet Letter was ineffective in achieving its purpose of satisfying readers because it did not come to a significant conclusion at the end and some of the main characters didn't receive enough focus. The author could have more effectively showed how Pearl shaped her later adult life by stating more information throughout the novel about her early life experiences. This addition would have significantly improved the novel because Pearl was a significant character that deserved a stronger focus. At the end of the novel, none of the characters surfaced as a winner above the others. The Scarlet Letter would have been significantly better in achieving its purpose if the author had written more about Hester and Dimmesdale at the end of the novel. Hawthorne didn't write in detail about their time together at the end of the novel. Instead, the characters died rather quickly and readers didn't get a chance to delve further into their lives to see if they could live happily after overcoming the ordeal of their sins.The Scarlet Letter is a well-known classic American piece of literature. Hawthorne effectively conveyed to readers the downsides of Puritan society during the mid-seventeenth century and values through expressing the hardships characters such as Hester, Dimmesdale, and Pearl had to endure due to the society and time that they lived in. However, the novel was ineffective because it didn't achieve its purpose of satisfying readers. The ending of the novel seemed rushed and didn't show or symbolize enough. Also, some of the main characters, such as Pearl, Hester, and Dimmesdale, deserved more credit in order to further exemplify their significance and everything that they symbolized throughout the novel."

1886,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,AGEIT17HENDIS,Alfred Johnson,0/0,5.0,1271980800,In The High Puritan Style- Again,"I started off a review of the more famous of 19th American writer Nathaniel Hawthorne's short stories by noting that the old social democratic literary critic and editor of ""Dissent"", Irving Howe, once noted that Mark Twain, and his post-Civil War works represented a dramatic break from the Euro-centric ante bellum American literary establishment. And on this question I agree with him. As I do on his choice of Nathaniel Hawthorne as an exemplar of that tradition. Certainly his most famous work, ""The Scarlet Letter"", reflects that European influence, and is justly place in the pantheon of that handful of important works that emerged in the early days of the American Republic.One of the of clearest links the ante bellum American literary establishment and the European tradition, especially from the English tradition was the need to pose and resolve some high moral question. And of course what is simpler to do that go back to the stark and isolated foundations of the white American tradition, the Puritan tradition. I know that if I were a writer and I wanted to dramatically portray the effects that physically isolated (and isolating) religiously-driven communities have on the individual, and on individual choice, those Puritan settlements from Cape Cod to Salem on the coast of Massachusetts in the 1600s would, at least get my serious consideration.So that, in part is what drives the action (if one can use that term usefully here) of a woman (naturally) banished from the tight-knit community (or so they claimed) by running off and having an affair with Mr. X. Now today that would create in the reader nothing but a big yawn, and maybe some spicy gossip, but hardly banishment, and hardly the necessity to wear a badge of courage sewn on your dress. Except maybe today one would advertise that status and place a video on ""YouTube"". And that is my moral point.Hester Prynne did not deserve the social opprobrium of the religious fundamentalists of her day. But old Hawthorne did a great service by creating a masterpiece to point out that moral ambiguity and dilemma back in the days."

However, I'm grateful I stuck with it, as in the end the story captured me. Unbelievably, before it was over, Hawthorne actually produced a real page-turner of a story!! But I have to give all praise to the wonderful character of Hester Prynne. In my limited exposure and experience to the world's great literature and associated characters, I have to believe she might rank among literature's greatest women. Strong and full of character, overcoming the Puritanical intolerance and ""ignominy"" heaped upon her; a woman of soft heart with a core of steel."

This is the theme of Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter. The heroine, Hester Prynne, is accused of committing adultery, and has to live with a scarlet letter `A' hanging from her neck. Because she wants to protect the dignity of her lover, she refuses to disclose his name.The story is set in the eighteenth century, when having a baby out of wedlock was considered to be extremely shameful. That may seem irrelevant to the present culture, but conflicts around shame and guilt are prevalent even today. So the emotional conflicts are as relevant today as they were in those days.Hawthorne is an expert in describing psychological conflicts. Even though his style may seem old fashioned, he dissects the human mind with the expertise of a modern psychologist. As he describes the course of the two lovers' relationship with society, Hawthorne expertly describes their emotional and character changes.A priest, a doctor and a wild little girl are some of the other colorful characters woven together to create a story full of suspense and surprises.If you like serious dramas, which deal in depth with complex human characters and situations, you will love reading this book."

It is as beautiful as prose can be, showcasing the amazing technique and depth that Hawthorne could communicate. It isn't trite story of a puritan scandal; rather, it is a penetrating exploration of shame, redemption, and true love. Melville had it right when he dedicated his book to the ""Genius of Hawthorne"". Not surprisingly, this is one of the few American novels on the list of Great Books, which should obviate any needless disputes about the quality of this novel constantly brought up by sophmoric readers that have little experience in literature.This edition is nicely bound and quite affordable. For such a great book, the introduction is unfortunately shallow and unscholarly. Instead of exploring the themes or structure of the piece, the write opts for a bland biography of Hawthorne, a light summarization of the novel along with the Custom House prologue, and finishes her essay with some obstuse comparisons of Hester Prynne with Monica Lewinksy. Making such idiotic references to pop culture prompts the reader to wonder if this person understood the book at all.Fortunately, the comments at the end of the novel are what makes this edition valuable. Reading the reviews of contemporaries, including Melville, add to the reader's understanding and they are nice pieces of analysis in themselves. The essay of Hawthorne's own son, Jullian, superbly catches the nuances of Hawthorne's style and should be held as a template for literary analysis.For the price and the reviews at the end, I highly recommend this edition of a timeless classic."

1898,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,A2FN25QS654CIT,A. E Smith,0/0,4.0,1090281600,A critique of The Scarlet Letter,"In high schools around the country, The Scarlet Letter is a required novel for students toread. Some enjoy it, while many others dread the task of reading this ?classic Americannovel?. I can relate to many who have felt as though they would rather do anything butread this novel; I too was required to read The Scarlet Letter as a junior in high school.However, after having read through this intricate novel more than once, I believe thedread that many feel can easily be turned to fascination and interest, if this novel is readcorrectly and intuitively.Throughout The Scarlet Letter, a web of intricate plots and themes arises. In thebeginning of the novel, the reader is given a detailed description of the New Englandsetting in which the novel takes place. A series of contrasting images is provided, suchas the ?ponderous iron-work? of the prison door, and the ?wild rose bush...covered indelicate gems?. Although these images may become confusing to some, contrastingimages such as these offer insight into the characters that are described in the next fewchapters. Some of the major characters in this novel include Rodger Chillingworth, theReverend Dimsdale, and Hester Prynne. However, the protestant women described in thesecond chapter are quite frequently overlooked, yet play an integral role in theadvancement of the novel. These women are first seen waiting at the prison door forHester Prynne to exit, and are described as ?goodwives?. They are portrayed as a moredelicate and briefer beauty than their ancestors had. Characters like these women arecrucial to the advancement of the plot, but are too often overlooked. While majorcharacters are most often examined, minor characters can carry the plot in crucial ways.Utilizing complex and witty characters within the novel, such as the women by the prisondoor, adds depth to the themes, which is something Hawthorne is very good at doing.As the story line deepens, we find ourselves in the midst of a nineteenth centurylove triangle, between Hester Prynne, Dimsdale, and Chillingworth. Hester, who ismarried to Chillingworth, has had an affair with the Reverend Dimsdale. Because of thisaffair, she becomes pregnant with an illegitemate child. When the community uncoversthe sin she has comitted, she is forced to wear a scarlet letter ?A? on her breast. Whilemany believe and teach that the letter stands for ?adultry?, it can be argued that the ?A?stands for something other than this theme.When Hester leaves the prison, she is described in a completely different mannerthan the women who awaited her at the prison door. In the second chapter, Hester isdescribed as ?...tall, with a figure of perfect elegance, on large scale?, which is starklydifferent from the description of the other women. The ?A?, in this case, could mean?admirable?, or even ?American?, unlike ?adulteress?. I have not heard this optiondiscussed or even acknowledged; it is only insisted in high schools that the ?A? onlymeans one thing, even though it is never even stated what the ?A? stands for.One of the biggest misses in the high school teachings of this book is the absenceof the Custom House Essay in the course syllabus. In the Custom House Essay,Hawthorne lays the plans for the entire novel. He carefully describes the New Englandtown he grew up in, and offeres readers an inside look at the men who worked in thecustom house. While never stating his dislike for these men, Hawthorne uses ironicdescriptions of these men to give the reader a true depiction of the leaders of their time.The Custom House Essay also contains Hawthorne?s definition of a ?romance?, anddescribes for the reader how he created the novel. Hawthorne appeals to the readerssenses by using both fiction and truth in this preface to his novel. It sets the stage for therest of the book, and plays upon the idea that the ?A? on Hester Prynne?s chest couldstand for more than just an adulteress.One of the major downfalls to The Scarlet Letter is the language style used in thebook. At times, certain words can be hard to understand, and the language used todescribe the setting can slow down the reading of the novel. However, this is not thefault of either the writer or the reader, because this novel was written in nineteenthcentury America, which is quite different from the world we are living in now.One of the biggest problems a reader could surface from reading the novel is theunderrepresentation of women and minorities. While the novel is centered around awoman, she is not given a distinct voice in the story, nor is she represented by a woman.She is forced to live on the outside of town, and is forced to wear a letter ?A? on herchest. When confronted by her husband Chillingworth, she is not even given the choiceto acknowledge him as her husband. Instead, she is told by him that she should notreveal his identity to anyone.Not only are women underrepresented, but minorites as well. There is nomention of any African American people in the novel, yet they were quite present innineteenth century America. The only minority mentioned is the unnamed Indian, wholike Hester, lives on the outskirts of town.Although certain aspects of the novel can confuse and hinder the reader, TheScarlet Letter is a novel which transcends time and location. It has become a majorAmerican novel not just because it was written about American life, but because itsthemes question what it truly means to be an American. I highly recomend reading thisnovel, and stronly encourage readers to include the Custom House Essay in their reading.Whether it be the first time, or one hundredth, The Scarlet Letter carries themes whichremain prevelant throughout American literature."

I say, Hawthorne's novel is not revolutionary or amazing in its subject, setting, or even characters, but rather in the way in which it unfolds. The story delves remarkably into the souls of several individuals in a New England Puritan town, gradually and ephemerally casting beams of soft light on new aspects of each's personalities and struggles. Each character is masterfully and magically revealed, and the tale strives for intimacy and understanding of each point of view in a complex circle of deceit and secrecy. I think it will be enjoyed by everyone who appreciates detailed and beautiful analysis of character, sentiment, thought, and human nature, but may not be ideal for those seeking constant action."

This book is about a woman who has an affair, choosing to bear the scarlet letter than reveal her lover's identity. Along side her is her ilegitamate daughter, a delightfully and hillariously strange character in the book. The scarlet letter is a good book having a melancholy but redeeming ending.

1902,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,A2ZPLXCN4EUWC6,Stephanie,0/0,4.0,1068076800,&quot;A Review of The Scarlet Letter&quot;,"&quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; is about a young woman named Hester Prynne who has a child out of wedlock. Set in Puritan, Boston, the people shun Hester, especially when she refuses to divulge the name of the baby's father. Her punishment is to wear a scarlet A on her dresses, which is where the title comes from. This book is one of the first true romances written. The main character, Hester, is a very strong, very independent woman character. I think the book is an excellent romance and social defiance.The first appearance of romance shows up in chapter 3, when the stranger shows up in the market, asking why Hester was standing on the platform. A townsperson then spins Hester's tale: Of how her English husband had sent her to Boston before he himself moved, of how no word had been heard of the husband in the two years that she had been there, and how she had had a child. The man then asks who the baby's father is, and the good townsperson answers by saying that Hester refuses to give the name, but that the man is undoubtedly in the crowd. In the end, we discover that the father is really Arthur Dimmesdale, her preacher and the stranger is really her long-lost husband. All throughout the book, this romantic triangle comes to play, giving this book depth and character as one of the first true romances.It is also a story of social defiance. The first instance of this is in chapter 2, when she walks out of the prison. Instead of being humble and meek, as the townspeople had expected, she holds her head up high and refuses to avert her eyes. All during the book, she wears her mark of shame with pride. In the end, the A no longer stands for adultress, but angel. She refuses to be beaten down, and this is such a strong statement. In those days, women were expected to be meek and subservient. It is a great example of social defiance.I think that Nathaniel Hawthorne should be given a medal of honor. During his time, women were not entitled to be strong. Basically they were there to cook and have children. If they didn't have a husband, they were basically expected not to be able to do anything. But the character of Hester Prynne proves them all wrong. She manages to defy the townspeople, raise a child, and become a heroine to other women. She managed to accomplish all of this all on her own. It is a wonderful portrayal of a woman's spirit.For a book written in the 1800's, it is actually quite easy for a teenager in the twenty-first century to read and relate to, especially for a girl. Most girls like romances, and a strong female character. It is an outstanding piece of work that is sure to be around for years to come."

I previously thought the coolest part was that a married woman had had an affair with a priest. This time around, however, I actually got sucked into the book itself, not into what had happened before.Yes, this book is extremely descriptive, but it isn't a book of what happened, but why it happened. Instead of having the reader determine or deduce the motives and minds of the characters, Hawthorne comes out and tells you. That's what makes it so timeless. Had he not written it with such density, I don't think it would be what it is today simply because times, customs, and opinions have changed so much. For many people, I think Dimmesdale's (somewhat hypocritical) pious behavior would have just been dismissed as simple cowardice.However, I'm not trying to say that the events of the story are those that only fit into past culture, many of these things happen today, but the treatment is different; it's much more open. For me, even knowing the ending of the story, I almost couldn't bring myself to read the rest because I felt transported into the mindset of the characters. I didn't feel the need to interpret, just observe."
1904,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,AC7MP9R2FKEAI,"Paul Miller ""___[_]D___""",0/0,5.0,1059782400,Letter A blooms red,"Hester Prynne and much of the framework of the story is modeled on Anne Hutchinson who in 1638 was imprisoned and then banished from Boston for being Antinomian, (anti-law), her belief being that love and personal religious experience were greater than the elderly Puritan authority. Hawthorne describes the rosebush by the prison door as springing up under the footsteps of the sainted Ann Hutchinson. Hester and Anne have several parallels, the dignified manner of facing their trials, rumors that each had a child by the devil, strong relationship and betrayal by a well respected Puritan clergyman, defiance of Puritan elders, punishments of prison and banishment, and both were advisors to other women. Hawthorne takes the A of Antinomian and makes it the A of adultrey because he wants to shine a brilliant spotlight on the workings of the human heart in the course of the narrative.Witchcraft plays a role in the Scarlet Letter. John Hathorne an ancestor of the author was one of the judges at the infamous Salem witch trials where most of the condemned and executed were women. Govenor Bellingham's sister Mistress Hibbins, an historical figure later hanged for witchcraft, believes herself to be a witch in this novel. Many believe Hester's child Pearl to be fathered by the devil and that Hester's A glows red in the dark. Hester tells Pearl she met the blackman in the forest once and that the A is his mark. Chillingworth ,Hesters elderly husband, practices alchemy or something close to it and his heart is darkened the most of the players in this tale. As Dimmesdale stands on the scaffold at night he sees a display of lights in the sky and it looks to him like a giant A marked out in lines of dull red light for his adultrey.Dimmesdale cares more for his ambition than for Hester and Pearl. The Puritans think him saintly and the truth gnaws away at him and weakens him. Hawthorne tells us at one point to ""Be True Be True"" meaning genuine, real, to show and be yourself warts and all.As in Hester's great art with her needle Hawthorne has crafted great art with this masterpiece.Some have confused the heralds description of what was on the tombstone thinking the words were on the stone. Only the red A on a black background is on the stone. The Heralds description is ""On a field, sable, the letter A, gules"". Gules is a heraldic word that also has a root meaning flowers, so a rendering of this in plain english would be: On a background, black, the letter A, blooms red."

Often when I discuss comparative literature, I tend to use the example of Charlse Dickens's &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, for in Dickens's famous novel, there are about five hundred pages of mere background information. And so, we have the style of Nathaniel Hawthorne presented to us: he is, in essence, a lover of symbolism and all things literarily analyzed. I really got into the story when the first pyre scene happened... Now, note, when I said pyre I meant pillar, for pyres are something entirely different and generally greek/medieval... Anyway, as I was saying, Hawthorned loves literary symbolism and creativity.

Hester is such a strong character; as she struggles to win back the respect of the community, she regains her self-respect, which, she realizes, is ultimately more important. Hawthorne sets Rev. Dimmesdale, a very weak character, opposite Hester perfectly. Chillingworth is, in fact, &quot;chilling,&quot; and little Pearl is a troublemaker but grows to be much like her mother. The book is a slow read but well worth the wait.

Like all great books, this novel deals with issues which are timeless and central to the human condition. Can (or should) the state legislate morality? If so, to what degree? Which is the greater sin, a momentary weakness or a sustained and conscious deception? Which is the greater punishment, public humiliation or private guilt? And, perhaps most importantly, what is the proper response to each? The novel provides clear and compelling examples of tragic consequences which can be avoided by the simple, but sometimes difficult, act of telling the truth. The permeating sadness of the story results from the failure of each character to do so.Despite comments here to the contrary, this book is not difficult to read or understand, and it is not dull if you can grasp its themes. The ideas expressed are intricate and symbolism is pervasive throughout the story. However, any reader who really wants to understand and enjoy the book should not have great difficulty in doing so. To those readers who feel challenged to appreciate this book, Hawthorne himself offers you a thought (on page 18 of my edition) which you should seriously consider --&quot;It contributes greatly towards a man's moral and intellectual health to be brought into habits of companionship with individuals unlike himself, who care little for his pursuits, and whose sphere and abilities he must go out of himself to appreciate.&quot;"

I recently read it again in my college literature class, and I learned to appreciate it even more. I picked up so much more the second time through. The thing that just blows me away is the author's use of symbolism and the way *everything* ties together...it's genius! Another amazing thing about this book is that it represents three different time periods: the time in which it took place (1600's), the time in which it was written (1800's), and the time in which you read it (present). So in a way it spans across centuries and connects to so many different generations. It's truly a timeless classic. I hate to be negative or insult anyone, but any person that hated this book is probably just an ignorant high school student who doesn't appreciate depth in a novel, and doesn't know a true masterpiece when they see one. This is also a great book for people who love American history (such as myself). It sheds a lot of light on the Puritan times."

This is the case with Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, a mundane, tedious read that stretches across an insufferable 250 pages. I don't see much in this novel that merits it the ""classic"" label; despite a small collection of praiseworthy subtleties in language, insufficiently engaging characters, plotlines, and writing styles turn this book into an undesirable story.Beginning with a needlessly long, unnecessarily convoluted introduction, The Scarlet Letter immediately discourages hopeful readers searching for an excellent read. Most of the introduction is superfluous, as are most of the words in Hawthorne's sentences. Not only is the beginning impossibly lengthy, it is also annoyingly uninteresting. I am not exaggerating when I say the introduction is completely uneventful; instead of beginning with an engaging prologue, Hawthorne chooses, for some reason, to bore his readers with a thirty-page explanation that readers just beginning to read the book will have no reason to continue on with. By starting out with such a dull preface, Hawthorne immediately cuts his audience in half. I'm sure that most people who pick up the book for fun quickly put it back after reading the first few pages of pretentious yet trivial garble. Hawthorne's droning on about nonsense that few people can understand, and even fewer can sympathize with, sets The Scarlet Letter off to a terrible start.Even worse, as the book picks up pace and moves on towards the main plot, there seem to be few signs of improvement in the narrator's mundane droning. You would think that the characters, including a vengeful, mad doctor, an audacious, rebellious Puritan outcast (who is, by the way, a female), and a seemingly saintly minister who safeguards a horrid sin, would greatly contribute to the excitement of the story. Unfortunately, these characters remain, for the most part, distant from the reader. They are developed fairly well; it's just that a typical reader in the current era can't find much in common with a Puritan minister, doctor, or outcast. This absence of engaging characters detracts significantly from the entire novel, keeping the reader from fully absorbing the story.To be fair, quite a few chapters are intriguing, and Hawthorne does write several noteworthy excerpts in his otherwise flat novel. His style is highly sophisticated, which is most likely the reason many people find the book boring. Filled with hidden symbols, allegories, and themes, The Scarlet Letter is not a simple book for passing the time. Hawthorne's writing often drags, and ends up sounding very mediocre. The novel seems to become more riveting at trivial times, and excessively dull during parts with elevated examples of symbolism, which a typical reader will have to trudge through.If you are willing to devote time and effort to reading the novel, you will probably find it decent, or possibly even worthy of being called a ""classic."" Casual readers, however, will not find this tale a good read, and will probably shy away from it after the first chapter."

Her community does not approve; what she has done requires trial and punishment. She suffers terrible guilt, but she treasures her child, Pearl, and keeps her secret (who is the dad?) to the end. The Scarlet Letter has a horribly overwritten and boring beginning, describing the inspiration for the book, to wit: a document found in the narrator's workplace. (A customs house in Salem, Massachusetts in the 1800s, where newly arrived ship captains must check in and pay a fee for docking their vessels.)The beginning goes on and on and on and on describing the narrator's fellow workers and circumstances and surroundings. All of which has almost no bearing on the plot. I'm guessing the author, Nathaniel Hawthorne, was putting several manuscripts together, or maybe he was just being paid by the word. Anyhow, I already knew the bare bones of the plot and kept wondering -- have I got the wrong The Scarlet Letter? When is the story going to start?Finally it begins. Here's the first scene: hapless Hester, babe in arms, is punished for her sin publicly. She has been sentenced to wear a symbol of her shame, a scarlet A for adultery. She has sewn it on the front of her dress and she stands in front of a sneering crowd of Puritans, wilting, guilty. Though ashamed, she does not weep or beg forgiveness, and she adamantly refuses to name her lover/the baby's father. By an amazing coincidence her long-lost aged doctor husband arrives at that moment! In time to see her shamed! Later when they meet face to face she won't tell him who the dad is, either. But he says he'll figure it out, and he does: it's the town's beloved minister. Dr. Prynn gives himself a new name, swears her to secrecy, and sets out to make the minister suffer.Misery commences and goes on and on for some time, as well, to the point the reader may think of abandoning the book (at least this one did). We learn of every pang of guilt and sorrow of Hester and the minister, of Hester's isolation and humiliation, of her lover's terrible guilt, of her husband's persecution of her lover, of her pretty little daughter's odd personality, which Hester attributes (possibly; it's hard to be sure) to the evil influence of her illegitimate birth. Finally the situation is resolved in a scene so well-written and captivating it seems hardly possible that the same author who wrote the rest of the book could have written it. Also it seems hardly possible that Hester could suddenly arrive at a sensible solution to everybody's problems. Also it seems hardly possible that the wussy minister, who should have confessed he was the dad at the start, is able to even think about saving himself. It is a wonder.The rest of the book is so hurried, no more than a summary of events, that I got the impression that an editor had taken Hawthorne in hand and said, ""no more, you've written enough!"" My sentiments exactly. If ever a book could have used some judicious cutting, The Scarlet Letter is that book. Perseverence in reading the whole long list of classics is what made me stick it out to the bitter end. I'm giving this novel 3 stars just because it's a classic, not because I think it's actually that good a read."

Roger Chillingworth, Hester Prynne's husband, returns after disappearing for years and secretly plans to destroy Dimmesdale because of his desire to avenge his injured pride.By setting the novel in a 17th century Puritan colony in New England, Miller is able to full examine the effects of guilt and sin on a person's soul under a pressured environment where religious beliefs and laws are strictly enforced. This is displayed through Dimmesdale's deteriorating health as he faces an inward battle. He fears the condemnation of the townspeople, but at the same time, feel obligated to take care of Hester Prynne and their child.The plethora of symbols and allusions in the story add to its profoundness.Hawthorne has a verbose and formal style, as shown through his diction and syntax. He uses antiquated words, even in the dialogues between Hester Prynne and Pearl, her young child. The lengthiness of the novel is due to excess of detail given.The Scarlet Letter has an intriguing plot that makes us reflect on our ethics and teaches us about revenge and guilt, but Hawthorne's proper diction and lengthy descriptions prevent readers from reading it continuously in one sitting."
1924,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,A35R1DF8A7AITI,Jacqueline Chan,0/2,3.0,1168473600,It's Decent,"I am truly amazed at how one novel can stir up so many emotions from its readers. Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter emphasizes the cruelty that people are capable of treating against others. He also demonstrates the toll that guilt has on people, restricting themselves from performing daily tasks in fear that they have to acknowledge their wrongdoings.Although I am very intrigued and captivated by the plot of the story, I found his writing style to be too descriptive and elongated for my liking. An important scenario that happens within fifty pages could be cut down to ten, but he tends to describe about every single detail possible, which irked me at times. Hawthorne's focus on such minute details may appeal to other readers, but it certainly did not have a positive effect on me.On the contrary, I applaud his utilization of allusions to the bible throughout the book. By encompassing the biblical allusions, he heightens the effects of certain actions such as Little Pearl's repetitive questionings towards her mother. The reader begins to fear Pearl, although she is only a child, because of her close resemblance to the devil. These allusions also enhance Hawthorne's development of the characters. Hawthorne really did do a thorough job of exposing the strengths and weaknesses of his characters to relate to his audience. Because the readers are aware of how a certain character acts, they are capable of recognizing the significance for Hawthorne to portray the character in a different light.Although the readers may have to put up with the extensiveness of the novel, I recommend this novel to anyone that is willing to take the extra time and effort to fully understand Hawthorne's themes, which are cleverly entwined within the novel; it is futile to toil through the lengthened plot without delving deeper into the text to comprehend its meaning. Reading the book the first time, I honestly believed that it was a decent novel despite the many complaints and criticisms that others gave me; but after I analyzed the novel myself for some considerable time, I almost considered it a classic tale of all time, with its many symbols, themes, and other literary elements that were hidden among the text that all lead to the Hawthorne's ingenuity at the very end, if I had not been reminded of his unnecessary tedious style. This should not hinder anyone from picking up the novel and reading it though because, in actuality, it really is an amazing piece."

Bayliss ""book queen""",0/1,4.0,970876800,better as an adult than a reluctant high schooler,"In many ways, this book is like an R rated movie. Sure, high school students who are forced to read it &quot;understand&quot; it superficially, but the material hits home once you have matured and experienced some of the themes brought up in the novel. I liked it in high school, but as an adult, it resonates much more. I just reread the book after having not looked at it for over 10 years. The beginning does drag a bit, but the superb chapters near the end when Dimmsdale meets Hester in the forest after having not seen her or Pearl for 7 years make it all worthwhile. Even the writing becomes more vivid. During one great scene, Dimmsdale is allowed a moment of realization when he says to Hester than Chillingsworth's sin is much blacker than his own because it was done with malice. Dimmsdale realizes that his soul is not the blackest of all and to me, this gives him some level of redemption, at least on a personal level. The last 8 chapters or so are spellbinding as they bring up themes of sin, lust, and love against the horrifying behavior of the evil &quot;physician&quot; Chillingsworth. If you are forced to read this in high school, try to get past the sometimes opaque writing and give it a chance."

It's not riveting enough, maybe because it was written in the 19th century. Things that are exciting more than a 100 years ago just don't seem all that interesting to me. It's hard to read because most of the book is composed of metaphors and other examples of figurative language. If you had to read it, I'd say give yourself at least three weeks."

As a demonstration of her will and furvor, she sews and wears a scarlet &quot;A&quot; which stands for &quot;adultery&quot;. Perhaps this &quot;A&quot; also stood as a reminder to the man who also committed these &quot;sins&quot; with her, the &quot;pure and religious&quot; Reverend Dimmesdale. Hester's unforgiving and avenging husband, Chillingsworth, soon finds that his unfaithful wife has borne a daughter from her &quot;sin&quot;, a child she calls &quot;Pearl&quot;. This even moreso enrages him, and causes him to seek out her lover. In life, our actions may not be condoned by society and there are certainly consequences to everything we do. Just as Hester Prynne wore her scarlet letter &quot;A&quot; on her breast so do we in our everyday lives (though of course our letters aren't tangibly displayed as was hers). The Scarlet Letter is a book with many lessons to teach. I read this book first when I was in fifth grade, a second time in high school, and now I own a copy. It shows us that not everyone is perfect, even the Puritains had their faults, and that if we truly love one another, we can look beyond these faults."

There are so many new, contemporary novles. If you want to another read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."

One of the things that I would watch out for, is the vocabulary and how it is used in the context. The vocabulary is very confusing at times. However, it can lead you on to another world by wisking you off in the times where the&quot;Scarlet Letter&quot; took place. Other than that, I think this book is very good. I personally liked the characters and their roles in the story. The main character,&quot;Hester Prynne&quot;, is written very carefully and it shows how she struggles to go on with her life. That is the only thing I can say about this book. You have to read the rest to find out what happens....."

1933,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,,,0/1,1.0,919987200,Long and Dry,"In writing the Scarlet Letter, Hawthorne brought up a few good points. For example, there were many instances in which he describes the suffering of secret sin through the eyes of Arthur Dimmesdale, Hester's child's father. As Hester grows stronger throughout the novel as a result of her repentance, Dimmesdale, the man with whom she cheated, grows weaker and weaker until he finally gives in at the end of the story. To reach these fine conclusions from the book, however, one must stay completely focused and search long and hard for the evidence. Buried beneath Hawthorne's dull insignificant speeches on content that literally has nothing to do with the story, one may be able to find a moral. In saying this, I am referring of course to the 54 page introduction that is almost totally irrelevant to the entire story. He describes everyone that works in the custom house with him and what they wear and eat and do in their spare time, and then in the last 4 or so pages, he talks about the importance of the scarlet letter. What a waste of paper! With all of the trees that he killed writing his intro, you would think that it would actually serve a purpose. Overall, my opinion on the novel is that it could be summed up in about 3-5 sentences, although Hawthorne drones on for about 250 pages of frequent symbolism and aristocratic dialogue. If you really want to read a story about the shame and suffering of secret sin, then I highly recommend reading &quot;The Minister's Black Veil&quot;, also by Hawthorne. This is a much shorter story with a lot more meaning and fewer words. It basically sums up all that he really wished to say in the Scarlet Letter in a different plot and setting."
1934,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,,,0/1,1.0,912470400,"Historically accurate it may be, but a boring read.","I read this &quot;Classic&quot; novel for a class, and must admit I was thoroughly disappointed. Hawthorne should have stuck to writing non-fictional books about the Puritan settlers. This book was a pill. There are so many American authors, and novels that could be taught in schools that could far exceed the entertainment level of this out of date story. Two thumbs down."

Unlike most people, I read this novel in college (I don't know why junior high teaches this book; it's way to advanced for that intensity of reading) and depicted it as a soap opera in Puritan society. The novel inhibits sex, suspense, drama, and romance all in one pakage. I found the invidious Roger Chillingwoth to be an extremely interesting aspect about the novel's well-rounded plot. The theme of the novel is sin, and how tragically easy it could destroy a normal town denizen. I mean, all 3 main characters are virtually consumed and eventually destroyed by their own private sins. Read this book; by doing so, one will appreciate truly powerful literature that still shakes our foundation today."

Overall the book was decent at best and could have been completed in no more than 50 pages or so. Hawthorne's writing is totally ridiculous. He goes on and on stating irrelevant details and fills page after page with unnecessary imagery. These pages consist of long paragraphs, some which encompass multiple pages. If I didn't have to read this for class I definitely would not have read it on my own. I'm not saying that it is a difficult novel, but it is an unpleasant one. In the end, if you are looking to read great American novels, skip over this one and go read some Steinbeck or Twain."

The book started out with excellent twists and turns, and I would constantly wonder about what each character would do, and where the book was going to go.

At that age who can appreciate Hawthorne's poignant prose, and insightful observations into a woman's heart; for he warns that the most wretched man is the one who&quot;procures the hand of a woman, and fails to procure the uttermost passion of her heart&quot;. A sixteen year old can not even begin to fathom what that entails. I recommend to those who have given this book poor reviews, to wait a few years and then reread this amazing novel which is an insightful journey into the one region that is worth exploring: a woman's heart! Also, the way females were mitreated at the dawn of our great country's rise to equality is a lesson worth pondering."

Mitchell,0/0,5.0,1245888000,The Scarlett Letter,"Hawthorne's theme of secret sin and the fault of all humans is once again present in this novel. A woman, Hester Prynne, has committed adultery, with a priest nonetheless. She is made to wear this shame, by having a scarlet letter sewn on to her clothing. She is shunned by all of her townspeople as they see the scarlet letter on her breast. The townspeople however, do not know the sin was committed with their new minister, Arthur Dimmesdale. Dimmesdale allows her to bear this burden alone. Hester's husband is believed to be dead, but he comes back as a doctor for the priest with the name of Roger Chillingworth. A chilling feeling is just what he inflicts upon people. He has a knowledge of natural medicines, and becomes the doctor for the priest, only so he can seek his revenge. The priest suffers from heart troubles, a burden of the hidden sin, and is on the verge of death. He goes and sees his and Hester's daughter Pearl, a sprite like girl, and promises to sail away with her and Hester. The ending is unexpected and sudden but also appropriate. The burden of secret sin, and the purging that comes from exposing this sin reigns throughout the novel. Beautifully written and wonderfully conceived, this novel is a timeless classic that will remain for years to come."

Robledo ""Author of the Aelnathan""",0/0,5.0,1229299200,AMAZING TALE OF THE FAR-REACHING CONSEQUENCES OF SIN AND DECEIT,"In The Scarlet Letter, Nathaniel Hawthorne tells a story of the results of sin. Set in Seventeenth Century Massachusetts, it is a tale of the life of Hester Prynne, who has been convicted of adultery. She is sentenced to wear a scarlet letter ""A"" on her chest, as a badge of dishonor. We follow her decisions to keep her lover secret, and how this bears down on her over time. We watch as her child (Pearl) resultant of the act grows into a wild daughter, unrestrained by her mother (who feels guilt from her sin, and who also questions the established morals of the society she lives in). All the while, her aged, learned husband comes closer and closer to discovering the identity of the man who took part in the adultery.Hawthorne describes all this with unique detail. Nearly every object -- whether it be a rose at a prison door, or a river in the woods -- contributes some symbolism to the plot. The language of the narrative is very fitting, and the dialogue is delightfully written in the correct form of the day. With small supporting details woven in (such as the few brief but important appearances of a witch named Mistress Hibbins) and the deep symbolism, The Scarlet Letter has an almost supernatural tone, while it still remains a perfectly realistic novel.Many consider The Scarlet Letter to be Nathaniel Hawthorne's crowning achievement. It has certainly stood the test of time, being a classic that is now over 150 years old, and still very well known. For anyone who enjoys this style of literature, this book is one to read.Ryan RobledoAuthor of the Aelnathan:"

Outside of school, I would never read in this genre, but for not being my style, it was actually very interesting. The reading moves slowly, more because of the lack of dialogue and action, and the long spiels of description and analytical discussion, than difficult wording. It offers a deep insight into how the human mind can so torture the body if the soul is afflicted, and how bottled-up sin and lust for revenge can destroy a person. If you're interested in what makes the human mind tick, then I highly recommend this book."

This is a testament to its originality and complexity. But do not be intimidated by this. This novel tells a story which everyone should be able to comprehend if time is given. Hawthorne clouds this novel with so many minor details and facts, but in between all of this lies a plot and message that is worth the read. If you are reading this for high school, I recommend you buy the cliff notes also, but ONLY TO READ ALONG WITH THE NOVEL FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING!!!

Though it was heavily laced with symbolism, the fact that Hester Prynne showed strength and dignity throughout in a situation that is still relevant today makes this one of my favorite books. I did not like Dimmesdale at all. He was almost weaker than you would think humanly possible, but I suppose that was Hawthorne trying to make a point. I thought it was overall a book that everyone should read due to its messages about standing up for what you believe in, self love, strength, determination and confidence. Hester is a rolemodel for all women because even though she had a man with no backbone, she made the decision to stand by him and not give him away and she never compromised herself. She even regained the respect of her fellow townspeople by turning the A she wore from a negative to a positive when she became an entreprenuer, which was unheard of in those days. She was the sole source of income and support for her daughter Pearl. Rev. Dimmesdale by the way should remain an examole of what not to do for a man in his situation. Although a little corny at times, it should stay on the list of books to be read by students of all ages. There is much to gain from it on many levels."

Clinton was scrutinized for his private, adulterous act in the oval room, but it was Hawthorne that wrote about this public punishment through the character, Hester Prynne. Written in the nineteenth century, about the Puritans in the seventeenth century, in Boston, Massachussetts, Hawthorne sets up the cruel punishment that Hester sufferred for her adultery. Having to wear a bright, red letter 'A' on her breast at all times, being forced to move to the outskirts of town, and being treated as a whore, Hester suffered for the love that she found in the pastor, Dimmesdale. Their love did not comply with the Puritan communal laws, nor by the laws of God, in turn resulting in the scrutinization of Hester and her daughter, Pearl. Discretion and true love are not rewarded in this story, although the love was more lively, brighter, and real, in comparison to the bland, monotonous marraiges of the Puritans. If one is in the mood for long, elaborated, descriptions of plot detail, in lue of the timeless themes, then this is the novel for you."

It started out about a Women names Hester Prynne who committed adultery. Her community and all who judged her made her wear the letter &quot;A&quot; on her chest to signify what she has done. Hester had been having an affair with her priest, Aurther Dimmesdale. Se was made to stand on a scaffold in the middle of town. Although it was supposed to be an embarrassing thing to have to do, she did not act ashamed at all. Pearl has a daughter named Pearl whom her husband finds out later that it is not his child but it is Aurthor Dimmesdale's. At the begining of this book it got a little confusing but once it started to pick up the pace it all fell into place.

Hawthorne's rich use of language adds to what is already an intensely compelling story. Hester Prynne is a standout among a throng of submissive Puritan women and one of the most interesting heroines in literature. She steadfastly stands up for herself and her child's well-being amidst a storm of controversy surrounding her actions. Symbolically and literally, this is a beautiful novel that explores the inner workings of the human heart and various facets of forgiveness, guilt, passion, pride, self-worth, and the standards by which we judge those around us."

My mom told me a brief description of the story, and her thoughts on the book made me want to read it. I finally got the chance to read it this year, and I was greatly disappointed. The novel failed to hold my interest at any point in the story. I could only read so many pages at one time as I found my thoughts wandering away from the story of Hester Prynne, her young daughter Pearl, and the affair that she had with one of the ministers in Boston. The vocabulary was quite advanced and often hard to comprehend. The lengthy descriptions of Hester's agony over this great sin she has committed were quite repetitive. When Nathaniel Hawthorne adds the complicated vocabulary to the descriptions of Hester that go on page after page, it creates frustration and a sense of hopelessness for the reader. Most of the time, I knew what Hester was thinking or what she was going to say before she thought it or said it. Even through all of the tedious descriptions, it was hard for me to identify with Hester Prynne since I have never been in her type of situation before. The only aspect of the novel that I really understood was the Puritan way of life. Hawthorne's description of the way that the Puritans lived was quite accurate. The Puritans were a very religious society based on high morals and respect. Once one did something to shame those morals, they were ultimately shunned from society. This aspect of Puritan society was one of the only points that was well illustrated by Hawthorne. Overall, the book was lifeless. I would recommend this book only to someone who has a large amount of both patience and time."

1999,B000N6DDJQ,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,A1AXGPKLL9Y3LD,Rhina,7/13,1.0,1096761600,The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne,"Getting through this book was quite a task. The wording and the pace make it a bit hard to follow. However, once you read deep into the plot, the web of characters and their relationships draw you in. This book is set in Colonial New England in the 1600s. Hester Prynne, protagonist, has been condemned to wear a scarlet letter (...) to remind the public of her sin of adultery. Reverend Dimmesdale, a public hero, struggles with guilt and personal hypocrisy. Roger Chillingworth is seen as the antagonist, consumed with hatred and revenge. These three characters make up a very intriguing story line that touches on controversial issues such as sin, lust, adultery, and primal human nature. This book can be easily compared to Kate Chopin's, The Awakening. Both deal with the repression of women and one woman's struggle to rebel against society. Each character attempts to broaden the closed minded views of their time and set the bar for women in the future. Although it was a tough read, I would recommend this book for its ability to relate to common issues."
